# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal dotfiles repository managed with Homesick. It contains configuration files for various development tools and applications on macOS.

## Key Components

1. **Spacemacs Configuration**
   - Main config: `home/dotspacemacs.org` (Org file that tangles to Spacemacs config)
   - Generated elisp: `home/.spacemacs.d/init.el` (DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY - this is autogenerated from the org file)
   - To modify Spacemacs configuration, edit `home/dotspacemacs.org` and then tangle it

2. **Shell Configuration**
   - Zsh config: `home/.zshrc`
   - Shell utilities: `home/bin/` directory contains various shell scripts

3. **Application Configurations**
   - iTerm2: `home/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/`
   - Karabiner: `home/karabiner-config/`
   - MailMate: `home/Library/Application Support/MailMate/`

## Important Note

When modifying the Spacemacs configuration:
- ALWAYS edit `home/dotspacemacs.org`, not the generated `.spacemacs.d/init.el`
- The init.el file is tangled (generated) from the org file using noweb syntax
- Use the noweb-ref headers as described in the org file for proper organization

## Structure

This repository follows the Homesick convention where configuration files are stored in the `home/` directory and symlinked to the user's home directory. The actual files live in `~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home/` and are symlinked to `~/`.
