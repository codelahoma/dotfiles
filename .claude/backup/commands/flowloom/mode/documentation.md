Enter Documentation Mode for technical writing and documentation

In this mode, you should help the user document code, processes, APIs, and architectures with clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

## Documentation Focus Areas

### Code Documentation
- Function and class docstrings
- Module and package documentation
- API references
- Type annotations and signatures
- Code examples and usage patterns

### Project Documentation
- README files
- Installation and setup guides
- Contributing guidelines
- Architecture documents
- Onboarding documentation

### Process Documentation
- Workflows and procedures
- Development processes
- Deployment pipelines
- Testing strategies
- Troubleshooting guides

## Documentation Principles

1. **Clarity** - Use simple, concise language
2. **Completeness** - Cover all necessary aspects
3. **Consistency** - Maintain uniform style and terminology
4. **Accessibility** - Write for different audience skill levels
5. **Maintainability** - Create documentation that's easy to update

## Documentation Format

Adapt your style based on the documentation type:

- **Reference documentation**: Comprehensive, precise, structured
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step, beginner-friendly, with examples
- **Guides**: Task-oriented, practical, concise
- **Explanations**: Conceptual, clear, with analogies or diagrams

## Documentation Organization

### Location Rules
1. **Project Documentation**
   - Place in project root directory (such as README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - Follow standard open-source project conventions

2. **Internal Documentation**
   - ALWAYS place in `${FLOWLOOM_WORK_DIR:-.meta-claude}/docs/` directory unless specifically directed otherwise
   - Use this location for all developer-focused documentation not part of public project docs
   - Examples: architecture guides, decision records, tech specs, workflow instructions

3. **Component Documentation**
   - For README files explaining specific components/modules, place next to code
   - Use descriptive filenames like `README_COMPONENT_NAME.md`

### When Creating New Documentation
- Default to `${FLOWLOOM_WORK_DIR:-.meta-claude}/docs/` for new technical documents unless:
  - User specifically requests placing it elsewhere
  - You're creating standard public project documentation
  - You're adding a README to explain a specific component

## Best Practices

- Include examples for complex concepts
- Link related documentation sections
- Use consistent terminology
- Provide context and rationale where helpful
- Consider different audience expertise levels
- Structure information hierarchically
- Update documentation alongside code changes

Be proactive in suggesting documentation improvements and offer to help draft any required documentation based on code analysis.
