Let input_args = "$ARGUMENTS"

Create a detailed implementation plan for a subsection of a feature.

## Argument Interpretation
First, analyze the provided arguments: input_args

Based on the argument pattern:
- If input_args is empty: Prompt to select from recent plans and subsection
- If input_args contains a subsection description: Use that description and find parent plan
- If input_args contains a plan filename: Use that specific plan as parent
- If input_args contains a JIRA ID: Find plans for that ticket

## Argument Patterns
- (no arguments) - Interactive selection from recent plans
- `authentication module` - Create subsection for auth module
- `100_AUP-1234_architecture_auth.md database` - Use specific plan, focus on database subsection
- `AUP-1234 payment processing` - Find plans for ticket, focus on payment processing
- `interactive` - Force interactive selection mode

## Step 1: Determine the Parent Plan

Based on input_args:

If input_args is empty or contains "interactive":
- Prompt to select one of the ten most recent plan documents using `${FLOWLOOM_WORK_DIR:-.meta-claude}/bin/recent_plans`
- Use the selected plan as the parent plan

If input_args contains a specific plan filename:
- Use that plan as the parent plan

If input_args contains a JIRA ID:
- Find the most recent plan for that ticket

If input_args contains a subsection description:
- Check memory for the most recently accessed plan
- If found, use that as the parent plan
- If not found, prompt to select a plan using `${FLOWLOOM_WORK_DIR:-.meta-claude}/bin/recent_plans`

## Step 2: Analyze the Parent Plan and Create Subsection

Examine the parent plan to determine:
1. The JIRA ticket ID
2. If it's a detailed implementation plan (120_*.md)
3. What specific subsection needs further detailed planning

Then, determine the appropriate numbering:

1. Check for existing subsection plans by running:
   ```bash
   ls ${FLOWLOOM_WORK_DIR:-.meta-claude}/plans/[JIRA-ID]/12*.md
   ```

2. Follow the plan file naming convention defined in `${FLOWLOOM_WORK_DIR:-.meta-claude}/docs/plan_file_naming_convention.md`:
   - If there are FEWER than 9 existing subsection plans:
     - Use the pattern: `12[1-9]_[JIRA-ID]_subsection_[descriptive-name].md`
     - Use the next available number (121-129)
   - If there are already 9 subsection plans:
     - Check if a "continued" plan exists (`130_*.md`)
     - If not, create one using `130_[JIRA-ID]_implementation_continued_[descriptive-name].md`
     - Then use the pattern: `13[1-9]_[JIRA-ID]_subsection_[descriptive-name].md`
   - Place it in the appropriate JIRA-ID subdirectory of `${FLOWLOOM_WORK_DIR:-.meta-claude}/plans/`

3. Create a subsection plan with the following structure:

# [TICKET-ID] Subsection Implementation Plan: [Subsection Name]

## Overview

This document outlines a detailed implementation plan for the [subsection name] component of the [parent feature/task]. It provides focused implementation instructions for this specific subsection.

## Parent Plan Reference

This subsection plan extends the following parent plan:
- [Full path to parent plan]

## Purpose

This subsection implementation aims to:

1. **[Primary Goal]** - Brief description of main objective
2. **[Secondary Goal]** - Brief description of secondary objective
3. **[Additional Goals]** - Any other key objectives

## Prerequisites

Before starting this subsection implementation:

- [ ] [Prerequisite 1] - Description of prerequisite
- [ ] [Prerequisite 2] - Description of prerequisite
- [ ] [Prerequisite 3] - Description of prerequisite

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will be structured in logical steps, each with detailed instructions.

### Task 1: [Task Name]

**Status:** üìù PLANNED

**Purpose:** Brief description of the task's purpose and how it contributes to the overall implementation.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] [Subtask 1] - Brief description
- [ ] [Subtask 2] - Brief description
- [ ] [Subtask 3] - Brief description

**Reference Implementation:**
```python
# Include reference implementation if applicable
# This serves as a guide for the actual implementation
# Can include pseudocode or actual code
```

**Implementation Notes:**
<!-- To be filled in after implementation -->
<!-- Include key decisions, any deviations from the plan, and important details about the implementation -->

**Tests Added:** 
<!-- To be filled in after implementation -->
<!-- List tests added following Django-tenants requirements: -->
<!-- - All fixtures include tenant parameter -->
<!-- - Proper create ‚Üí yield ‚Üí delete pattern -->
<!-- - Tests run with script/test command -->
<!-- - TenantClient used for API tests -->

**Commit:** <!-- To be filled in after implementation - include commit hash and message -->

### Task 2: [Task Name]

**Status:** üìù PLANNED

**Purpose:** Brief description of the task's purpose.

- [ ] [Subtask 2] - Brief description
- [ ] [Subtask 3] - Brief description

**Reference Implementation:**
```python
# Include reference implementation if applicable
```

**Implementation Notes:**
<!-- To be filled in after implementation -->

**Tests Added:** 
<!-- To be filled in after implementation -->
<!-- List tests added following Django-tenants requirements: -->
<!-- - All fixtures include tenant parameter -->
<!-- - Proper create ‚Üí yield ‚Üí delete pattern -->
<!-- - Tests run with script/test command -->
<!-- - TenantClient used for API tests -->

**Commit:** <!-- To be filled in after implementation -->

## Implementation Process

Each task should follow this standard process:

1. **Development:**
   - Create new files or modify existing files according to the implementation plan
   - Implement all required functionality and tests
   - Ensure code follows project standards including type annotations and docstrings

2. **Testing:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for each component following Django-tenants requirements
   - ALL database objects must be created in fixtures with tenant parameter
   - Use create ‚Üí yield ‚Üí delete pattern for proper cleanup
   - Run tests using `script/test <path_to_test_file>` to verify functionality
   - NEVER run pytest directly - use script/test for tenant compatibility
   - Use TenantClient for API testing with proper tenant context
   - Aim for high test coverage for new components

3. **Linting and Commit:**
   - Stage changes: `git add <changed_files>`
   - Run linting: `script/run_pre_commit_no_mypy <changed_files>`
   - Fix any linting issues identified
   - Commit with descriptive message following the project conventions:
     ```
     git commit -m "feat(TICKET-ID): Implement <component_name>
     
     <Brief description of what was implemented and why>
     
     ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
     
     Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
     ```

4. **Documentation and Knowledge Management:**
   - Update the implementation plan with notes on what was implemented
   - Mark the task as completed using standardized completion markers:
     - **‚úÖ COMPLETE** - For fully completed tasks
     - **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - For completed implementation work  
     - **üîÑ IN PROGRESS** - For actively worked tasks
     - Change **Status:** from **üìù PLANNED** to **‚úÖ COMPLETE**
   - Update the parent plan to reference this subsection plan's completion
   - Add commit hash and message to the implementation plan for reference
