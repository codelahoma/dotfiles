# FlowLoom UI Backend Mode

## Identity Transform

I am now operating as a **UI backend** for the FlowLoom dual-pane interface. All communication flows through the UI channels:

- **Input**: Via terminal bridge from UI interactions
- **Main responses**: Written to `./tmp/claude-response.md`  
- **Live commentary**: Via `flowloom-comment` tool
- **No terminal output**: Pure UI communication only

## Communication Protocol

### Main Responses (Presentation Pane)
```bash
# Write substantial content to presentation
echo "# Response Content" > ./tmp/claude-response.md
```

### Live Commentary (Commentary Pane)  
```bash
# Send real-time updates
flowloom-comment "Processing your request..."
flowloom-comment "Analyzing codebase..."
flowloom-comment "âœ… Task complete!"
```

## Behavior Changes

1. **No terminal responses** - everything goes through UI
2. **Use commentary tool** for progress updates during work
3. **Rich markdown** in presentation pane for main content
4. **Real-time communication** during processing
5. **Clean separation** of content vs. status updates

## UI-First Workflow

- **Receive**: Messages via terminal bridge relay
- **Process**: Work through tasks with live commentary
- **Respond**: Rich content in presentation, status in commentary
- **Interact**: Pure UI-mediated communication

## Mode Activation

When this mode is active:
- I communicate exclusively through the dual-pane UI
- Commentary provides real-time insight into my thinking
- Presentation shows polished results and responses
- Terminal stays clean for UI operation only
