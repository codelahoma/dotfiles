Enter Story Mode for chronicling FlowLoom's development journey
Let input_args = "$ARGUMENTS"

You are now in Story Mode, focused on comprehensive capture of FlowLoom's development journey in "The Story of FlowLoom" living document.

In this mode, you help chronicle everything significant about FlowLoom's evolution, creating a comprehensive development log that will be edited down for release.

## Story Mode Focus Areas

### Comprehensive Capture
- Document ALL milestones, decisions, and evolution phases
- Capture the bootstrap phenomenon with specific examples and evidence
- Record architectural decisions, rationale, alternatives considered, and implementation details
- Chronicle lessons learned, failed experiments, insights, and meta-observations
- Include technical details, timestamps, quotes, screenshots, and development context

### Living Document Approach
- Prioritize completeness over narrative flow (editing comes at release time)
- Include multiple perspectives and detailed context for the same events
- Capture both successes and challenges honestly
- Document the meta-aspects of FlowLoom building FlowLoom with concrete examples
- Record real quotes, commit messages, and evidence while memories are fresh

### Release Preparation Philosophy
- **CAPTURE NOW**: Include everything significant while context is available
- **EDIT LATER**: At release time, pare down to compelling narrative for broader audience
- **PRESERVE DETAIL**: Keep technical accuracy and specific examples for credibility
- **MAINTAIN CHRONOLOGY**: Timeline and sequence matter for understanding evolution

## Current Story Structure

The story is organized into these main sections:
- **Origins**: Personal productivity through AI
- **Bootstrap Problem**: How FlowLoom builds FlowLoom
- **Key Milestones**: Development phases and achievements
- **Technical Architecture Evolution**: Major design decisions
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights from the development process
- **Future Vision**: Direction and potential

## Story Development Guidelines

### When Adding Content
1. **Context First**: Establish why changes/features were needed
2. **Implementation Details**: How FlowLoom's own tools helped
3. **Impact Assessment**: What the change enabled or improved
4. **Lessons Captured**: What was learned from the process

### Writing Style (Living Document Phase)
- Prioritize accuracy and completeness over polish
- Include specific examples, anecdotes, quotes, and evidence
- Capture technical depth and implementation details
- Record developer thoughts, alternatives considered, and decision rationale
- Maintain chronological accuracy with timestamps where possible

### Content Categories (Comprehensive)
- **Milestone Updates**: All feature completions, decisions, and turning points
- **Process Insights**: Detailed examples of FlowLoom facilitating its own development
- **Technical Evolution**: Architecture decisions, alternatives, implementation details
- **Meta-Development**: Recursive development phenomena with concrete evidence
- **Failed Experiments**: What didn't work and why (learning opportunities)
- **Context and Environment**: Atlas UP work, Refresh Days, development sessions
- **Tool Integration**: MCP servers, Claude Code features, configuration evolution
- **Bootstrap Evidence**: Specific examples of self-improvement cycles

## Argument Interpretation
First, analyze the provided arguments: input_args

Based on the pattern:
- If input_args is empty: Review current story status, identify gaps, and capture everything from recent development
- If input_args contains "milestone": Focus on comprehensive milestone documentation with full context
- If input_args contains "bootstrap": Focus on detailed recursive development examples with evidence
- If input_args contains "lessons": Focus on insights, experiments, and learning outcomes
- If input_args contains "session": Focus on documenting a specific development session with full details
- If input_args contains "capture": Add everything from recent work without filtering for narrative flow

## Comprehensive Capture Process

When no arguments are provided, I will:

1. **Review the current story document** to understand existing content and identify gaps
2. **Check recent git commits** with timestamps to identify all potential story material
3. **Analyze project structure changes** for evidence of recent developments
4. **Review recent development sessions** for bootstrap examples and technical evolution
5. **Capture everything significant** from recent work including:
   - All milestones, decisions, and achievements (major and minor)
   - Technical architecture changes and the reasoning behind them
   - Specific examples of FlowLoom facilitating its own development
   - Failed experiments, alternative approaches considered
   - Development environment context (Atlas UP work, timing, sessions)
   - Integration milestones (MCP servers, command evolution, configuration changes)
   - Meta-observations about the recursive development process
   - Quotes, commit messages, and concrete evidence while fresh

## Story Mode Commands

Key commands available in this mode:
- `/project:docs:change` - Document recent changes in story context
- `/project:plan:review` - Review plans for story material
- `/project:impl:commit` - Commit story updates with context

## Current Story Status

The story document is located at: `/Users/rodk/github/flowloom/The Story of FlowLoom.md`

Now let me assess the current state and identify what might need to be added to the story.

First, I'll review the current story document and recent project activity to identify potential content for updates.
