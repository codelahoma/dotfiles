{"type":"entity","name":"dotspacemacs.org","entityType":"Configuration","observations":["Rod's literate Spacemacs configuration with 2600+ lines and 90 noweb blocks for organized Emacs setup","VERIFIED: The 'to-organize' noweb-ref in the junk drawer section (lines 2256-2613) IS active and being included in the main configuration. ~350 lines of mixed configurations are currently in use but need reorganization into proper sections per analysis in display.md","STATUS: Completed Phase 1 analysis. Junk drawer contains valuable configs for navigation, language-specific settings, applications, and utility functions. Ready for Phase 2 reorganization into proper noweb sections. Next: decide reorganization priority and structure.","DECISION: All rk/ namespaced symbols should be renamed to codelahoma/ to align with Rod's public internet persona since this is a public repository.","COMPLETED: Navigation & Movement reorganization. Configs were already properly organized in Interface section. Renamed all rk/ symbols to codelahoma/ (51 replacements). Navigation section includes evil-easymotion, centering advice, and bookmark hooks.","COMPLETED: mu4e email system completely removed. Eliminated entire mu4e section (~150 lines), layer configuration, contexts, keybindings, and junk drawer references. Rod no longer uses mu4e for email.","COMPLETED: Dead code removal. Eliminated ~70 lines of commented code including elfeed-goodies functions, old Python hooks, mode-line font functions, and orphaned comment fragments. Significantly cleaned up junk drawer section.","COMPLETED: Language layer cleanup. Removed 4 unused languages - Prolog, SQL, R (ESS), and Hy (including ob-hy package and org-babel configuration). Reduced from 28 to 23 language/markup systems. Cleaner, more focused language setup.","COMPLETED: Additional language cleanup. Removed PlantUML (layer + JAR paths + org-babel) and GraphViz (layer) - confirmed no dependencies. Total reduction: 6 unused languages removed (Prolog, SQL, R, Hy, PlantUML, GraphViz). Down from 28 to 21 language/markup systems.","COMPLETED: Utility function cleanup. Removed xah-title-case-region-or-line function (~60 lines of complex code with hardcoded word arrays) and its keybinding. Reduced from 24 to 23 utility functions. Significantly simplified codebase by removing unnecessary complexity.","ISSUE: After cleanup, Emacs startup is aborting due to jsonrpc errors before showing final timing display. Need to investigate LSP/language server configurations that might be affected by language layer removals.","RESOLVED: Startup issue was Copilot-related, not from our cleanup. Without github-copilot layer, Emacs starts cleanly with only a stale copilot-mode hook error. All language removals, mu4e cleanup, and other changes working perfectly. Cleanup was successful."]}
