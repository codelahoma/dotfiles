# Claude Code Security Boundary: Compound Bash Commands

**Date**: 2025-05-29
**Context**: Command namespace consolidation session

## Issue
Claude Code triggered permission prompts for compound bash commands during command structure analysis and migration.

## Commands That Triggered Prompts
1. Echo statements with compound operators:
   ```bash
   echo "=== MISSING IN FLOWLOOM NAMESPACE ===" && for cat in coord shell worker; do echo "Missing category: $cat"; find .claude/commands/$cat -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null; done
   ```

2. Multiple copy operations chained:
   ```bash
   cp .claude/commands/coord/*.md .claude/commands/flowloom/coord/ && cp .claude/commands/shell/*.md .claude/commands/flowloom/shell/ && cp .claude/commands/worker/*.md .claude/commands/flowloom/worker/
   ```

## Security Boundary Identified
- **Trigger**: Compound bash commands using `&&` and `;` operators
- **Not triggers**: Individual commands, simple echo statements, `.claude` directory access
- **Root cause**: Security system flags chained operations as higher risk

## Design Implications
- Prefer separate bash tool calls over compound commands
- Break complex operations into individual commands
- Consider MCP filesystem tools for file operations when available

## Workaround
Use multiple individual bash tool calls instead of chaining operations with compound operators.
