# Coordination Workflows and Best Practices

## Overview
Best practices and proven workflows for effective multi-Claude coordination using FlowLoom's permission-free coordination system.

## Core Coordination Workflows

### 1. Basic Task Assignment Workflow

#### Controller Perspective
```
1. Initialize coordination session
   /coord:init

2. Check system status
   /coord:status

3. Dispatch tasks to workers
   /coord:dispatch "Research async patterns" research high
   /coord:dispatch "Implement async examples" coding medium

4. Monitor progress
   /coord:status (repeat as needed)

5. Handle task completion
   - Review worker outputs
   - Dispatch follow-up tasks
   - Coordinate integration work
```

#### Worker Perspective
```
1. Announce to coordination session
   /worker:announce 85299 research,analysis,documentation

2. Wait for task assignments
   - Monitor for task notifications
   - Check coordination status periodically

3. Complete assigned tasks
   - Work on assigned tasks
   - Document progress and results
   - Report completion to controller

4. Re-announce availability
   /worker:announce 85299 [updated-capabilities]
```

### 2. Collaborative Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Research and Planning
```
Controller Tasks:
- Dispatch research tasks to research specialists
- Gather requirements and analyze constraints
- Create development roadmap

Research Workers:
- Investigate technologies and patterns
- Analyze existing solutions
- Document findings and recommendations

Output: Comprehensive research documentation
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
```
Controller Tasks:
- Review research findings
- Break down implementation into discrete tasks
- Assign implementation tasks to coding specialists

Architecture Workers:
- Design system architecture
- Define interfaces and data models
- Create implementation specifications

Output: Detailed implementation plan and specifications
```

#### Phase 3: Parallel Implementation
```
Controller Tasks:
- Coordinate parallel development streams
- Monitor progress and resolve dependencies
- Manage integration points

Coding Workers:
- Implement assigned components
- Write tests and documentation
- Report completion and integration requirements

Output: Implemented components ready for integration
```

#### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
```
Controller Tasks:
- Coordinate integration activities
- Dispatch testing and validation tasks
- Manage quality assurance process

Testing Workers:
- Perform integration testing
- Validate functionality against requirements
- Document issues and recommendations

Output: Tested, integrated solution
```

### 3. Problem-Solving Workflow

#### Issue Identification
```
1. Problem Discovery
   - Worker encounters issue
   - Reports to controller via coordination session
   - Provides context and error details

2. Problem Analysis
   /coord:dispatch "Analyze [specific issue]" analysis high
   - Research specialist investigates root cause
   - Documents findings and potential solutions

3. Solution Development
   /coord:dispatch "Implement solution for [issue]" coding high
   - Coding specialist implements fix
   - Tests solution thoroughly

4. Solution Validation
   - Original worker validates fix
   - Integration testing performed
   - Solution documented for future reference
```

### 4. Knowledge Sharing Workflow

#### Documentation Coordination
```
1. Documentation Planning
   - Controller identifies documentation needs
   - Assigns documentation tasks to appropriate specialists
   
2. Collaborative Writing
   /coord:dispatch "Document [component/process]" documentation medium
   - Multiple workers contribute expertise
   - Controller coordinates consistency and completeness

3. Review and Refinement
   - Cross-review by different specialists
   - Integration of feedback and improvements
   - Final approval and publication
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Effective Task Design

#### Task Granularity
- **Too Large**: "Build entire authentication system"
- **Too Small**: "Add one line of code"
- **Just Right**: "Implement JWT token validation with error handling"

#### Clear Requirements
```
Good Task Description:
"Research Python async/await best practices for web APIs, focusing on:
- Performance optimization patterns
- Error handling strategies  
- Testing approaches
- Integration with FastAPI/Django"

Poor Task Description:
"Look into async stuff"
```

#### Capability Matching
```
Research Tasks → Research specialists
- Investigating technologies
- Analyzing patterns
- Comparative studies

Coding Tasks → Implementation specialists  
- Writing code
- Building features
- Creating tests

Documentation Tasks → Documentation specialists
- Writing guides
- Creating examples
- Maintaining docs

Analysis Tasks → Architecture specialists
- System design
- Performance analysis
- Integration planning
```

### 2. Coordination Communication

#### Status Updates
```
Regular Check-ins:
- Controller runs /coord:status every 30-60 minutes
- Workers report significant milestones
- Blockers communicated immediately

Progress Indicators:
- Use descriptive task status updates
- Include completion percentages when helpful
- Share intermediate results for feedback
```

#### Issue Escalation
```
Level 1: Worker Self-Resolution
- Worker attempts to solve independently
- Documents approach and results
- Reports resolution or escalation need

Level 2: Peer Consultation
- Worker requests help from peers
- Knowledge sharing within coordination session
- Collaborative problem-solving

Level 3: Controller Intervention
- Controller reassigns or reprioritizes
- Additional resources allocated
- Workflow adjustments made
```

### 3. Quality Assurance

#### Code Review Coordination
```
1. Implementation Complete
   - Worker completes coding task
   - Submits for review via coordination

2. Review Assignment
   /coord:dispatch "Review [component] implementation" code_review high
   - Different specialist performs review
   - Focus on quality, security, maintainability

3. Feedback Integration
   - Original implementer addresses feedback
   - Iterative improvement process
   - Final approval and integration
```

#### Testing Coordination
```
Unit Testing:
- Assigned to original implementer
- Test coverage requirements specified
- Automated testing preferred

Integration Testing:
- Separate specialist for objectivity
- Cross-component interaction focus
- Real-world scenario validation

Performance Testing:
- Specialized performance testing tasks
- Load testing and optimization
- Benchmarking against requirements
```

### 4. Session Management

#### Session Lifecycle
```
Initialization:
- Controller starts with /coord:init
- Clear session goals established
