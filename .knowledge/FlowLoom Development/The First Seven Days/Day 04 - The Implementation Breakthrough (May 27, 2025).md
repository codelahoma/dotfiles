# Day Four: The Implementation Breakthrough
**May 27, 2025 - 21 Commits: Quality Over Quantity**

## The Major Breakthrough

Day four delivered FlowLoom's **most significant technical achievement**: the memory-based multi-Claude coordination system. With only 21 commits compared to day three's 51, this was a day where **implementation quality trumped velocity**.

## The Crown Achievement

### Multi-Claude Coordination Implementation
```
commit b3b4f2a: "feat: Implement memory-based multi-claude coordination system"
```

**Technical Breakthrough:**
- **~300 lines of code** vs 1000+ in previous file-based approach
- **7 core coordination commands** fully implemented
- **9/9 integration tests passing** immediately
- **MCP memory-based architecture** replacing complex file coordination

**Core Commands Implemented:**
1. `conductor:start` - Initialize coordination session
2. `conductor:status` - Monitor coordination state  
3. `conductor:assign` - Delegate tasks to workers
4. `conductor:collect` - Gather worker results
5. `worker:join` - Connect to coordination session
6. `worker:report` - Submit task completion
7. `coordination:cleanup` - Session cleanup and archival
