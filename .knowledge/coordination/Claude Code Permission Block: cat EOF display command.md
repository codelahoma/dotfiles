# Claude Code Permission Block: cat EOF display command

## Incident Details
- **Date**: 2025-05-28T19:20:00Z
- **Session**: Worker coordination session 85299
- **Worker ID**: worker_91625

## Command Attempted
```bash
cat << 'EOF'
âœ… Task Completed Successfully!
==============================

Worker Status Update:
   Worker ID: worker_91625
   Status: Available
   Current Task: none
   Previous Task: task_research_async_85299 (completed)
   
Ready for new task assignments in session 85299.

Available worker commands:
   /worker:status - Check current worker status
   /worker:announce - Re-announce capabilities if needed
EOF
```

## Permission Context
- **Permission Type**: Bash command execution
- **Command Purpose**: Display task completion confirmation
- **Use Case**: Showing formatted status update after completing coordination task

## Analysis
The command was a simple display operation using a here-document (heredoc) to show formatted text. This appears to be an overly cautious permission prompt for what is essentially a print/echo operation.

## Alternative Solutions
1. Use echo commands with escaped newlines
2. Use printf for formatted output
3. Write to a temporary file and read it
4. Use MCP operations to display status through memory observations

## Lessons Learned
- Simple display operations can trigger permission prompts
- Here-documents (cat << EOF) may be flagged even for read-only operations
- Consider using built-in echo/printf for status displays
