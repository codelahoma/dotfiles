# Claude Code Permission Block: Echo Append to Gitignore

**Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Session**: 11110-docs  
**Context**: Cleaning up session artifacts from git commits

## Command Attempted
```bash
cd "/Users/rodk/github/flowloom/sessions/session-11110-docs" && echo ".flowloom/
.flowloom/sessions/
.flowloom/backups/" >> .gitignore
```

## Permission Details Captured
**Permission Type**: File modification (append to .gitignore)
**User Choice**: Denied permission request
**Context**: Trying to prevent session artifacts from being committed in future

## Goal & Context
- Clean up documentation PR by removing session-specific files
- Update .gitignore to prevent .flowloom/ directories from being committed
- Ensure session isolation doesn't pollute main branch commits

## Analysis
- Echo with multi-line append to .gitignore triggered permission
- File modification operations require user consent
- Working in session directory but still protecting git configuration files

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Manual .gitignore edit**: Use file editor instead of shell append
2. **Separate commits**: Handle .gitignore changes in different commit
3. **Main branch approach**: Make .gitignore changes on main branch instead
4. **Direct file write**: Use Claude's file editing tools instead of shell

## Status
Successfully cleaned session artifacts from PR using git reset/recommit approach. .gitignore update blocked but not critical for immediate goal.

## Notes
- Session artifacts successfully removed from PR
- Clean commit created with only documentation files
- PR now safe to merge to main branch
- .gitignore update can be handled separately
