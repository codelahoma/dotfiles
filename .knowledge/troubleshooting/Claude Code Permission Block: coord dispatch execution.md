# Claude Code Permission Block: coord:dispatch execution

## Incident Details
- **Date**: 2025-05-28T18:53:00Z
- **Session**: 85299 (Multi-Claude Coordination Controller)
- **Command Attempted**: /coord:dispatch "Research Python async/await best practices and patterns" research high
- **Block Type**: Task tool execution interrupted by user

## Context
- **Goal**: Dispatch a research task to available workers in coordination session 85299
- **Available Workers**: worker_91625 (research capabilities), worker_4197 (coding capabilities)  
- **Session State**: Active coordination session with 3 workers available
- **Previous Tasks**: 2 cancelled research tasks in same session

## Technical Details
- **Tool Used**: Task tool with coord:dispatch command lookup
- **Expected Behavior**: Create task entity, assign to worker_91625, update coordination status
- **Actual Result**: Request interrupted by user before completion
- **Shell PID**: 85299 (cached for session)

## Permission Type
- **Claude Code Permission**: Not directly a Claude Code permission block
- **Issue Type**: Task tool execution interruption
- **User Action**: Manual interruption of tool execution

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Direct Memory Commands**: Use mcp__memory__create_entities directly to create task
2. **Manual Task Assignment**: Create task and worker assignment separately
3. **Simplified Dispatch**: Use basic task creation without full coordination workflow

## Lessons Learned
- Task tool execution can be interrupted during complex operations
- Direct memory operations may be more reliable for coordination commands
- Consider breaking complex coordination operations into smaller steps

## Next Steps
- Implement direct memory-based task dispatch as fallback
- Test coordination commands with simpler task assignments
- Document reliable patterns for multi-Claude coordination
