# Claude Code Permission Block: cd to Parent Directory

## Incident Details
- **Date:** 2025-01-27
- **Session:** session-5189-website
- **Working Directory:** `/Users/rodk/github/flowloom/sessions/session-5189-website`

## Blocked Command
```bash
cd /Users/rodk/github/flowloom
```

## Permission Type
Directory navigation restriction - Claude Code blocks navigation to parent/sibling directories outside the original working directory.

## Use Case Context
Attempting to sync `.claude/settings.local.json` changes from gh-pages branch back to main branch. The gh-pages branch had additional recent commands (`"Bash(git stash:*)"`) that needed to be merged with main branch's settings without overwriting main's unique recent commands.

## Error Message
```
ERROR: cd to '/Users/rodk/github/flowloom' was blocked. For security, Claude Code may only change directories to child directories of the original working directory (/Users/rodk/github/flowloom/sessions/session-5189-website) for this session.
```

## Root Cause
Claude Code's security model restricts directory traversal to prevent access to files outside the intended session scope. This is a security feature, not a bug.

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Git Commands (Recommended):** Use `git show main:file` and `git checkout main -- file` to access/modify main branch files
2. **Patch Creation:** Create diff patches and apply them to target branches
3. **Relative Path Access:** Use `../../` paths to access parent files (if permitted)
4. **Worktree Commands:** Use git worktree operations to work with multiple branches

## Implemented Solution
Used git commands to extract and merge settings files:
```bash
# Extract main branch settings
git show main:.claude/settings.local.json > /tmp/main_settings.json

# Compare and merge with current branch
# Apply changes back to main branch using git operations
```

## Lessons Learned
- Always design workflows that respect Claude Code's directory restrictions
- Git operations are the preferred method for cross-branch file operations
- Session worktrees have limited directory scope by design
- Document security boundaries to improve future command design

## Impact
Low - Alternative solutions available and implemented successfully.

## Prevention
Design session-based workflows to use git operations rather than directory navigation for cross-branch file access.
