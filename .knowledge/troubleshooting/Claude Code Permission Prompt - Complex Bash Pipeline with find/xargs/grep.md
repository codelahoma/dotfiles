# Claude Code Permission Prompt: Complex Bash Pipeline with find/xargs/grep

**Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Session**: opus-chat (Shell ID 72040)  
**Context**: Searching for remaining grandiose content during FlowLoom cleanup

## Command Attempted
```bash
find plans/FlowLoom -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l -i "revenue\|market\|enterprise\|platform\|ecosystem\|investor\|valuation" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "001_FlowLoom_vision_single-user-tool\|002_FlowLoom_grandiosity_cleanup_guide\|010_FlowLoom_specification_open-source-contribution-guide" | head -10
```

## Permission Details
- **Type**: Bash command execution
- **Prompt Style**: Interactive dialog with Yes/No options
- **Security Concern**: Complex pipeline with file searching and content analysis

## Use Case Context
Goal was to find remaining plan documents containing grandiose business/commercial language that should be cleaned up or archived as part of repositioning FlowLoom as a single-user tool.

## Analysis
Claude Code appears to flag complex bash pipelines for user approval, especially those that:
1. Search through file systems (`find`)
2. Read file contents (`xargs grep`)
3. Use multiple piped commands
4. Could potentially access sensitive content

## Alternative Approaches
1. Break into simpler commands:
   - First: `find plans/FlowLoom -name "*.md"`
   - Then: grep each file individually
2. Use built-in tools: `Grep` tool with pattern matching
3. Use `Task` tool for complex searches

## Recommendation
For complex file searches, consider using Claude Code's built-in search tools rather than bash pipelines to avoid permission prompts.
