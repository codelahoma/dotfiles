# Claude Code Permission Prompt: Cat Pipe to Pbcopy

**Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Session**: opus-chat (Shell ID 72040)  
**Context**: Trying to copy research clarifications to clipboard for Opus 4 Deep Research

## Command Attempted
```bash
cat /Users/rodk/github/flowloom/plans/FlowLoom/004a_FlowLoom_research_clarifications_personal-tools.md | pbcopy && echo "Research clarifications copied to clipboard!"
```

## Permission Details
- **Type**: Bash command execution
- **Prompt Style**: Interactive dialog with Yes/No options
- **Security Concern**: Piped command that writes to system clipboard

## Use Case Context
Attempting to copy the research clarification responses to clipboard so they could be pasted into Claude Opus 4 Deep Research interface.

## Analysis
Claude Code appears to flag commands that:
1. Use pipes between commands
2. Write to system clipboard (`pbcopy`)
3. Combine multiple operations with `&&`

This is interesting because `pbcopy` is a fairly benign operation - it only writes to clipboard, doesn't read or modify files.

## Alternative Approaches
1. Copy file contents manually from terminal
2. Use built-in Read tool and copy from Claude's output
3. Open file in editor and copy from there
4. Break into separate commands (cat first, then pbcopy)

## Pattern Observation
We're seeing a pattern where Claude Code is conservative about:
- Complex bash pipelines (find | xargs | grep)
- Clipboard operations (pbcopy)
- Any command combining multiple operations

This suggests the permission system may be pattern-matching on command complexity rather than actual security risk.
