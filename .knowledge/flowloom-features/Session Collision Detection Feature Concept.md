# Session Collision Detection Feature Concept

## Problem Observed
User has accidentally entered the wrong FlowLoom session twice in one afternoon. This suggests a need for better session awareness and collision detection.

## Current Situation
- User is in `session-5189-website` (gh-pages branch)
- This session is specifically for website development
- User may have intended to work in a different session but ended up here

## Feature Concept: Intelligent Session Awareness

### Core Idea
FlowLoom could detect when the type of work being performed matches the context of another active session better than the current one.

### Detection Mechanisms
1. **File Pattern Analysis**
   - Website work: Changes to .html, .css, .md in docs
   - Backend work: Changes to .py, .js in src/
   - Documentation: Changes to plans/, docs/

2. **Git Branch Detection**
   - gh-pages branch → website session
   - feature/* branches → feature development sessions
   - main branch → core development

3. **Recent Command Analysis**
   - Jekyll commands → website work
   - Docker commands → infrastructure work
   - Test commands → testing session

4. **Memory Context**
   - Check recent observations in other sessions
   - Compare work patterns across sessions

### User Experience
When potential collision detected:
```
⚠️ Session Context Mismatch Detected

You're in: session-backend-api (main branch)
Your work looks like: Website development (editing docs.html)

Active session that might be better:
- session-5189-website (gh-pages branch)
  Last activity: 10 minutes ago
  Context: "Fixing documentation links"

Switch to session-5189-website? (y/n)
```

### Implementation Considerations
- Should run automatically on session entry
- Could run periodically during work
- Need to avoid false positives
- Should be helpful, not annoying

### Benefits
1. Prevents duplicate work across sessions
2. Maintains cleaner session contexts
3. Helps users stay organized
4. Reduces cognitive load of remembering which session is for what

## Next Steps
This is currently a concept based on observed user behavior. Would need to be designed and implemented as part of FlowLoom's session management system.
