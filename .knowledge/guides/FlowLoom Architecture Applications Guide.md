# FlowLoom Architecture Applications Guide

Created comprehensive documentation exploring 40 distinct applications of FlowLoom's multi-agent coordination and memory architecture beyond software development.

## Document Location
`docs/flowloom-architecture-applications-report.md`

## Contents Overview

### 20 Organizational Applications
Including medical diagnosis coordination, scientific research management, legal case preparation, supply chain orchestration, emergency response, and more.

### 20 Personal Applications  
Including personal health tracking, home renovation planning, fitness journey tracking, creative writing assistance, personal memory palace, and more.

### Implementation Guide
Detailed step-by-step guide for Sonnet 4 to implement any variant from a fresh FlowLoom repository, with emphasis on:
- Sample data generation (minimum 100 entities, 500 relationships, 1000 observations)
- Agent design patterns
- Memory schema construction
- Workflow implementation
- Demonstration scenarios
- Query templates and visualizations

## Key Insights
- FlowLoom's architecture is domain-agnostic and can be applied to any field requiring multi-agent coordination with persistent memory
- The core patterns of entities, relationships, observations, and agent coordination translate naturally across domains
- Sample data generation is critical for effective demonstrations - aim for 6+ months of temporal data with realistic patterns

## Usage
This guide serves as a blueprint for anyone wanting to adapt FlowLoom's patterns to their specific domain, whether organizational or personal use cases.
