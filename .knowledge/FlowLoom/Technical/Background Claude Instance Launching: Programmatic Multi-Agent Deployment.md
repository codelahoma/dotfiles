# Background Claude Instance Launching: Programmatic Multi-Agent Deployment

## Vision: Autonomous Agent Spawning

The ultimate evolution: FlowLoom programmatically launching Claude Code instances in the background as needed.

## Use Cases

### Auto-Scaling Development:
```bash
# Master detects heavy workload
Master: "Launching 2 test agents and 1 doc agent for this build..."
# Spawns: claude-code --agent test-runner
# Spawns: claude-code --agent doc-writer
```

### Task-Specific Agents:
```bash
# User starts complex refactoring
Master: "This looks like a large refactor. Launching code-analyzer agent..."
# Background: claude-code --mode agent --role analyzer --project /current/path
```

### Event-Driven Spawning:
```bash
# Git hook triggers
Master: "New commits detected. Launching CI agent..."
# Auto-spawn for continuous integration workflow
```

## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Process Management:
```bash
# Direct process spawning
claude-code --background --mode agent --role test-runner

# Session management
tmux new-session -d -s "flowloom-agent-test" claude-code --agent

# Containerized agents
docker run -d claude-code --agent --role doc-writer
```

### Agent Lifecycle Management:
- **Spawn**: Launch with specific role/configuration
- **Monitor**: Health checks, resource usage
- **Scale**: Add/remove agents based on workload
- **Terminate**: Graceful shutdown when done

### Communication Channels:
- **Shared filesystem**: Task queues, status files
- **Named pipes**: Real-time communication
- **Database**: SQLite coordination tables
- **Memory systems**: Existing FlowLoom memory infrastructure

## Agent Specialization Framework

### Predefined Agent Types:
```yaml
test-runner:
  command: "claude-code --agent test-runner"
  capabilities: [pytest, jest, integration-tests]
  resources: [filesystem, git]
  
doc-writer:
  command: "claude-code --agent doc-writer" 
  capabilities: [markdown, api-docs, readme]
  resources: [filesystem, web-search]
  
code-analyzer:
  command: "claude-code --agent analyzer"
  capabilities: [static-analysis, security-scan, metrics]
  resources: [filesystem, git, sqlite]

build-monitor:
  command: "claude-code --agent build"
  capabilities: [ci-cd, deployment, monitoring]
  resources: [filesystem, git, external-apis]
```

### Dynamic Agent Creation:
```bash
# User request triggers agent spawning
User: "Run comprehensive security analysis"
Master: "This requires security expertise. Launching security-agent..."
# Spawns with security-specific prompts and tools
```

## Coordination Architecture

### Master as Orchestrator:
- **Resource allocation**: Assign agents to available cores/memory
- **Task distribution**: Route work to appropriate specialists
- **Result aggregation**: Collect and present unified results
- **Conflict resolution**: Prevent file/resource conflicts

### Agent Discovery:
```bash
# Master queries available agents
flowloom:system:agents:list
# Output: test-runner (idle), doc-writer (busy), analyzer (starting)

# Agent registration on startup
echo "agent-001:test-runner:idle:$(date)" >> .flowloom/agents/registry
```

### Graceful Degradation:
- **Agent failure**: Master redistributes work
- **Master failure**: Agents elect new coordinator
- **Resource constraints**: Throttle agent spawning

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Manual Background Launching
- Script-based agent spawning
- Basic coordination via shared files
- Simple role specialization

### Phase 2: Automatic Agent Management  
- Master-driven spawning based on workload
- Health monitoring and restart
- Resource-aware scaling

### Phase 3: Intelligent Agent Ecosystem
- AI-driven agent selection and optimization
- Predictive spawning based on patterns
- Self-organizing agent clusters

## Technical Challenges

### Process Management:
- **Session isolation**: Prevent agent interference
- **Resource limits**: CPU, memory, file handle management
- **Clean shutdown**: Graceful termination of agent processes

### State Synchronization:
- **Shared context**: Keep agents informed of project state
- **Version control**: Coordinate git operations across agents
- **Database access**: Prevent SQLite locking conflicts

### Security Considerations:
- **Agent privileges**: Limit agent capabilities
- **Process isolation**: Sandbox agent execution
- **Resource access**: Control filesystem/network permissions

## Revolutionary Implications

This would enable:
- **Truly parallel AI development**: Multiple specialized AIs working simultaneously
- **Self-scaling workflows**: System adapts to complexity automatically  
- **Persistent background processing**: Long-running tasks without user interaction
- **Specialized expertise**: Agents optimized for specific domains

The master session becomes an AI project manager, orchestrating a team of specialized AI agents. This could fundamentally change how complex software development happens.

## Demo Potential for Tuesday

Imagine showing:
```bash
User: "Refactor the authentication system"
Master: "This is complex. Launching code-analyzer and test-runner agents..."
[Shows 3 terminal windows with different Claude instances working]
Master: "Agent-1 has identified 12 affected files..."
Master: "Agent-2 is running impact analysis tests..."
Master: "Coordination complete. Here's the refactoring plan..."
```

This would be a powerful demonstration of AI coordination and the future of development workflows.
