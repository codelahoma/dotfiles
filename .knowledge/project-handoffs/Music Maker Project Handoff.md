# Music Maker Project Handoff

## Context
This document captures all necessary information for picking up the Music Maker project in a dedicated development session.

## Project Overview
**Music Maker** - A music creation/generation application (details to be defined)

### Current Situation
- Project was mentioned in session-5189-website (gh-pages branch)
- Needs to be moved to appropriate development session
- No existing code or implementation yet
- Project is in initial conceptualization phase

## Recommended Session Setup

### 1. Create New Session
```bash
# From main FlowLoom directory
flowloom session new music-maker-dev

# Or use git worktree directly
cd /Users/rodk/github/flowloom
git worktree add sessions/session-music-maker feature/music-maker
```

### 2. Session Context to Establish
When entering the new session, the following needs to be defined:

#### Project Definition
- [ ] What type of music maker? (MIDI sequencer, AI generator, loop-based, etc.)
- [ ] Target audience (musicians, beginners, producers, etc.)
- [ ] Platform (web app, desktop, mobile, CLI tool)
- [ ] Core unique value proposition

#### Technical Decisions
- [ ] Technology stack
  - Frontend framework (if applicable)
  - Backend technology
  - Audio libraries/APIs
  - Database needs
- [ ] Architecture approach
- [ ] Third-party integrations

#### Feature Scope
- [ ] MVP features
- [ ] Future feature ideas
- [ ] Technical constraints
- [ ] Performance requirements

## Potential Approaches

### Option 1: Web-Based Music Maker
- **Tech**: Web Audio API, React/Vue, Node.js backend
- **Features**: Browser-based sequencer, sample library, export to WAV/MP3
- **Example**: Like Chrome Music Lab but more advanced

### Option 2: AI-Powered Music Generator
- **Tech**: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, music generation models
- **Features**: Generate music from prompts, style transfer, MIDI export
- **Example**: Like MuseNet or Jukebox but accessible

### Option 3: Collaborative Music Platform
- **Tech**: Real-time collaboration (WebRTC), cloud storage
- **Features**: Multi-user sessions, version control for music, social features
- **Example**: Like Google Docs but for music creation

### Option 4: Music Education Tool
- **Tech**: Interactive tutorials, gamification
- **Features**: Learn instruments, music theory, composition
- **Example**: Like Duolingo for music

## Questions to Answer First
1. What problem does Music Maker solve?
2. Who is the target user?
3. What makes it different from existing solutions?
4. What's the simplest valuable version we can build?
5. What are the technical requirements/constraints?

## Development Plan Template

Once project is defined, create plans following FlowLoom structure:
```
001_MusicMaker_vision_project-definition.md
010_MusicMaker_requirements_user-stories.md
020_MusicMaker_research_audio-libraries.md
100_MusicMaker_architecture_system-design.md
200_MusicMaker_implementation_core-audio-engine.md
```

## Next Steps for New Session

1. **Define the project** - Answer the key questions above
2. **Create initial plans** - Document vision and requirements
3. **Research phase** - Investigate audio libraries and existing solutions
4. **Prototype** - Build simplest possible version to validate approach
5. **Iterate** - Expand based on what works

## Session Recommendations

- Use a development session (not website session)
- Create feature branch: `feature/music-maker`
- Consider if this connects to FlowLoom or is separate project
- Set up proper project structure from start
