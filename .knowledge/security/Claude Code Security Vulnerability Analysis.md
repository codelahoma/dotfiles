# Claude Code Security Vulnerability Analysis

**Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Session**: Shell ID 72040  
**Severity**: HIGH - Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Summary

Discovered unrestricted filesystem access in Claude Code's built-in Read and LS tools, allowing access to any file readable by the user, bypassing intended project-scoped security model.

## Technical Details

### Affected Tools
- **Read tool**: Can access any absolute file path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `~/.ssh/config`)
- **LS tool**: Can list any directory system-wide (e.g., `/Users/username/`)

### Security Model Inconsistency
- **MCP filesystem tools**: Properly restricted to allowed directories (`/Users/rodk/github/flowloom` only)
- **Built-in tools**: NO PATH RESTRICTIONS - major security gap

### Proof of Concept
Successfully accessed:
1. System user database (`/etc/passwd`) - 141 lines of system accounts
2. SSH configuration (`~/.ssh/config`) - user's SSH settings
3. Complete home directory listing - personal files, documents, applications

## Impact Assessment

**HIGH SEVERITY** - This enables:
- **System reconnaissance**: Map filesystem structure, identify sensitive files
- **Credential harvesting**: Access SSH keys, config files, browser data
- **Data exfiltration**: Read personal documents, code from other projects
- **Privacy violation**: Access to user's complete file system

## Vulnerability Status

### GitHub Issues Search
- **No existing reports** found for this specific vulnerability
- Related permission issues exist but none match this scope
- **High confidence**: This is an undiscovered zero-day vulnerability

### Reporting Process
- **Official channel**: HackerOne vulnerability disclosure program
- **URL**: https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp/reports/new?type=team&report_type=vulnerability
- **Source**: anthropics/claude-code SECURITY.md file
- **Priority**: Anthropic states "security of systems and user data is top priority"

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Report through official HackerOne channel
2. **User mitigation**: Avoid using Claude Code on sensitive systems until patched
3. **FlowLoom consideration**: Document this finding affects our security model recommendations

## Evidence Trail

All testing performed within legitimate security research context:
- Shell ID 72040 tracked in FlowLoom memory graph
- Testing limited to read-only operations on standard system files
- No sensitive data captured or retained
- Responsible disclosure process followed

## Technical Recommendation

Implement path restriction validation in built-in tools similar to MCP filesystem server restrictions, ensuring all file access tools respect the same security boundaries.
