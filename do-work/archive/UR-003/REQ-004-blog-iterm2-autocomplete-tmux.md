# Blog Article: Recreating iTerm2 Autocomplete in tmux

## What
Write a tutorial-style blog article explaining how we recreated the iTerm2 autocomplete feature in tmux. Should walk readers through the motivation, approach, and implementation.

## Context
The article should cover the process of bringing iTerm2's autocomplete functionality into the tmux environment, written as a tutorial that others can follow.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear deliverable (blog article) but need to explore the codebase to understand what iTerm2 autocomplete recreation was implemented and how.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: The output is a blog article. Need to discover the existing implementation details first, then write.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **Script location**: `~/.local/bin/tmux-autocomplete` (100-line bash script)
- **Keybinding**: `M-;` bound at tmux runtime level (`bind-key -T root "M-;" run-shell ~/.local/bin/tmux-autocomplete`)
- **How it works**: Captures scrollback buffer, extracts words matching prefix left of cursor, presents in fzf popup, sends completion suffix as keys
- **Key technologies**: tmux capture-pane, grep, fzf, tmux popup, tmux send-keys
- **Blog system**: ox-hugo, source files in `~/Dropbox/org/blog/`, Hugo site at `~/github/codelahoma.github.io`, posts in `posts/` section

*Generated by Explore agent + manual investigation*

## Implementation Summary

- Created `~/Dropbox/org/blog/tmux-autocomplete.org` — ox-hugo blog post (~1300 words)
- Tutorial-style article covering: motivation, 3-phase approach (find prefix, search scrollback, fzf popup), tmux APIs used, installation instructions
- Proper HUGO frontmatter with tags :tmux:fzf:bash:
