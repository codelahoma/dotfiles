# Personal GTD-Zettelkasten Architecture Options

## Context
Building a personal productivity system that deeply integrates GTD and Zettelkasten within Spacemacs, optimized for individual use with zero compromises for multi-user scenarios.

## Architecture Option 1: Custom Monolithic System

**Overview**: A single, tightly-integrated Elisp package that implements exactly what you need, how you need it, with your personal workflow hardcoded for maximum speed.

**Key Components**:
- `codelahoma-org.el` - Your complete system in one file
- Personal capture templates with your specific contexts
- Custom agenda views matching your daily patterns
- Hardcoded paths to your org files
- Your keybindings under `SPC o o`

**Data Flow**:
- Direct capture → Your inbox.org
- Processing functions tuned to your decision patterns
- Reviews scheduled for your actual free time
- Knowledge links optimized for how you think

**Pros**:
- Blazing fast - no abstraction overhead
- Exactly matches your workflow
- Easy to hack and modify on the fly
- Single file to maintain and understand
- Can hardcode your preferences

**Cons**:
- Less portable if you change workflows
- Harder to share specific components
- All changes require editing one large file
- Testing is more manual

**Best For**: You want maximum speed and complete control, happy to maintain one large file
**Implementation Complexity**: Low (for you, since you know your needs)

## Architecture Option 2: Lightweight Enhancement Layer

**Overview**: Leverage battle-tested packages (org-gtd + org-roam) but wrap them with your personal customizations and unified interface.

**Key Components**:
- Stock `org-gtd` for GTD foundation
- Stock `org-roam` for Zettelkasten base
- `codelahoma-gtd-personal.el` - Your customizations only
- Thin integration layer between the packages
- Personal keybinding setup

**Data Flow**:
- Packages handle heavy lifting
- Your layer adds personal touches
- Integration points where packages meet
- Custom capture templates override defaults

**Pros**:
- Benefit from community bug fixes
- Faster initial setup
- Can leverage package documentation
- Easier to update core functionality
- Less code to personally maintain

**Cons**:
- May include features you don't need
- Less control over core behavior
- Need to work around package assumptions
- Performance overhead from unused features

**Best For**: You want quick setup with proven foundations, willing to accept some bloat
**Implementation Complexity**: Very Low

## Architecture Option 3: Hybrid Personal System

**Overview**: Build your own GTD engine but use org-roam for Zettelkasten, creating the best of both worlds with personal GTD workflows and robust knowledge management.

**Key Components**:
- `codelahoma-gtd-core.el` - Your custom GTD implementation
- Stock `org-roam` for knowledge management
- `codelahoma-bridge.el` - Connect GTD tasks to knowledge
- Personal review workflows
- Unified capture system

**Data Flow**:
- Custom GTD capture → Your workflow
- Knowledge capture → org-roam
- Bridge enables task→note connections
- Reviews integrate both systems

**Pros**:
- Complete control over GTD workflow
- Proven knowledge management system
- Can optimize GTD for your exact needs
- Still benefit from org-roam ecosystem
- Good balance of control vs maintenance

**Cons**:
- More initial development for GTD side
- Need to maintain compatibility bridge
- Two different philosophies to reconcile
- Some mental model switching

**Best For**: You have specific GTD needs but want robust knowledge management
**Implementation Complexity**: Medium

## Recommendation for Personal Use

Given your vision of a frictionless personal system:

**I recommend Option 1 (Custom Monolithic) because:**
- You know exactly what you want
- Speed is your top priority
- You're the only user/maintainer
- You can hardcode everything for maximum efficiency
- No compromises needed for generalization

**Alternative: Option 3 (Hybrid) if:**
- You want the proven org-roam knowledge graph
- You're willing to trade some speed for robustness
- You like the idea of separating concerns

**Skip Option 2 unless:**
- You need something working TODAY
- You're happy with 80% solution
- You don't mind working around defaults
