# High-Level Implementation Plan: Hybrid Personal GTD-Zettelkasten System

## Feature Summary
A deeply personalized productivity system combining a custom-built GTD engine tailored to your exact workflow with org-roam's proven knowledge management capabilities. This hybrid approach gives you complete control over task management while leveraging robust, community-supported knowledge tools.

## Architecture Overview
**Hybrid Personal System**: Custom GTD implementation + org-roam Zettelkasten
- **GTD Side**: Hand-crafted Elisp matching your exact workflow patterns
- **Knowledge Side**: Stock org-roam with personal configurations
- **Bridge**: Smart integration layer connecting tasks to knowledge
- **Interface**: Unified keybinding system under `SPC o o`

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
**Complexity**: Low
- Set up project structure and core files
- Install and configure org-roam
- Create basic file organization structure
- Establish development/testing workflow
- Initial keybinding namespace setup

### Phase 2: Custom GTD Engine Core (Week 2-3)
**Complexity**: Medium
- Build capture system with your personal templates
- Implement inbox processing workflow
- Create task state management (TODO/NEXT/WAITING/etc.)
- Design data structures for projects and contexts
- Develop core GTD file operations

### Phase 3: Personal Workflow Implementation (Week 3-4)
**Complexity**: Medium
- Implement your specific contexts (@computer, @home, etc.)
- Build custom agenda views matching your daily patterns
- Create processing functions for your decision flow
- Add quick capture keybindings
- Implement auto-save functionality

### Phase 4: Review Cycles (Week 4-5)
**Complexity**: Medium
- Daily review workflow and templates
- Weekly review automation
- Monthly/Quarterly review structures
- Review history tracking
- Metrics collection for personal insights

### Phase 5: Knowledge Integration Bridge (Week 5-6)
**Complexity**: High
- Design task-to-note linking system
- Implement bidirectional references
- Create knowledge extraction from completed tasks
- Build project knowledge bases
- Develop smart knowledge surfacing during task work

### Phase 6: Unified Interface (Week 6-7)
**Complexity**: Low
- Complete keybinding system under `SPC o o`
- Polish capture templates
- Optimize workflow transitions
- Performance tuning
- Personal customization options

### Phase 7: Polish and Optimization (Week 7-8)
**Complexity**: Low
- Speed optimizations for instant capture
- Error handling and recovery
- Backup strategies
- Documentation for future-you
- Migration from current system

- No external services or APIs needed

## Potential Challenges

1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Challenge: Bridging custom GTD with org-roam paradigms
   - Solution: Clear separation of concerns, minimal coupling

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - Challenge: Maintaining instant capture with growing data
   - Solution: Lazy loading, smart caching, indexed searches

3. **Migration Path**
   - Challenge: Moving from current system without losing data
   - Solution: Incremental migration tools, parallel running period

4. **Habit Formation**
   - Challenge: Building new muscle memory
   - Solution: Similar keybindings to current workflow, gradual transition

5. **Future Maintenance**
   - Challenge: Keeping system maintainable over years
   - Solution: Clear code structure, comprehensive self-documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual GTD operations
- Validate state transitions
- Ensure data integrity
- Performance benchmarks

### Integration Testing
- Test GTD-to-Zettelkasten workflows
- Validate cross-system operations
- Check keybinding conflicts
- Review workflow completeness

### Personal Acceptance Testing
- One week parallel run with current system
- Daily workflow validation
- Stress test with real capture volume
- Review cycle effectiveness

### Performance Testing
- Capture speed benchmarks (target: <1 second)
- Processing time for 50+ items
- Agenda generation speed
- Knowledge search responsiveness

## Success Criteria
- Capture anywhere in under 2 seconds
- Process 20 inbox items in under 5 minutes
- Zero lost tasks or ideas
- Natural workflow that doesn't require thinking
- Knowledge surfaces when needed without searching
