# Unified Org-Roam GTD System Recovery

## Context Recovery
Rod asked me to check display.md to recover the org system design we discussed previously. Found comprehensive unified system design that combines:

## Key Design Elements
- **Philosophy**: "Org-Roam as Knowledge Base, Org-Agenda as Action Engine"
- **Visual Preservation**: 21 color schemes + 9 bullet sets maintained
- **Context Switching**: Work/Personal/Unified modes with dedicated keybindings
- **File Structure**: Organized ~/org/ with work/personal separation + unified roam
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless capture templates and agenda views

## Implementation Status
- Currently on `org-mode-gtd-refactor` branch
- Untracked `home/org-files/` directory suggests implementation in progress
- Existing visual system already in place in spacemacs config
- Missing core GTD workflow components

## Critical Features
- SPC o o keyspace for all org operations
- Context-aware capture templates (work/personal/roam notes)
- Dashboard agenda views (w/p/u for work/personal/unified)
- Smart file organization preserving knowledge in roam
- Rich keybinding system for efficient workflow

## Next Steps Required
1. Check current org-mode configuration status
2. Assess what's already implemented in home/org-files/
3. Plan implementation strategy to complete the system

This is a sophisticated design that balances knowledge management with practical GTD workflow while preserving extensive visual customizations.
