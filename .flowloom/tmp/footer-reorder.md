Footer reordered - table moved to top of output.

## Changes Made:
1. Moved table display to top of footer output
2. Reordered footer structure to: Table → Usage → Next Steps
3. Removed leading newline from steps_section
4. Updated return statement to put table first

## New Output Order:
1. **Table** (Mem/Doc status, Dir/Branch info, Context)
2. **Usage instructions** (Type 'go' to continue...)
3. **Next Steps** (numbered list of actions)

## Benefits:
- Status information immediately visible at top
- Memory indicators get prime real estate
- Usage and next steps follow logically after status
- Better visual hierarchy with most important info first

This ensures the memory system status and current context are the first things visible when the footer displays.
