Footer Memory Integration Test - 2025-06-08

## Session Activity:
- Successfully added todo item for footer display testing
- User requested validation of enhanced footer memory logging workflow
- About to test complete footer functionality with memory integration

## Decision Made:
- Footer will be displayed after this interaction to demonstrate:
  1. Automatic memory logging prompts (internal)
  2. Visual status display with git stats and context
  3. Interactive pause point for user continuation
  4. Memory system status and tracking reminders

## Discovery:
- Todo system integration with footer workflow successful
- Memory logging protocol now embedded in footer command
- Ready to validate complete dual-purpose footer functionality

This tests whether the footer serves both as user information display and AI memory logging trigger.
