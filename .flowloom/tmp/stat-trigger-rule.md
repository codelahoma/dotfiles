# "stat" Trigger Rule Implementation

## What Was Added
Added special trigger rule to CLAUDE.local.md for first-prompt testing.

## Trigger Behavior
If user's first prompt is exactly "stat", FlowLoom AI should immediately provide:

1. **Methodology Knowledge Confirmation**
   - Dual memory systems understanding
   - Command pattern proficiency
   - Documentation workflow awareness

2. **Current Context Summary**
   - Active objectives and recent work
   - Session continuity demonstration
   - Discovery and learning integration

3. **Tool Proficiency Display**
   - Relative path requirements
   - --from-file patterns
   - Essential command syntax

4. **Next Steps Awareness**
   - Pending todo items
   - Logical progression paths
   - Ready-to-execute actions

This provides rapid validation that startup context loading worked and FlowLoom AI is fully operational.
