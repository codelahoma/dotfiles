# Configuration Mode Discovery

## New Capability Found
Claude Code has a configuration mode activated by `/project:mode:config` that provides:

### Command Development Focus
- Creating/improving coordination commands
- Managing .claude/commands/ structure  
- Testing command functionality
- Organizing commands into categories

### Configuration Management
- CLAUDE.md (project-wide)
- CLAUDE.local.md (user-specific)
- .claude/settings.json (project settings)
- .mcp.json (MCP server configs)

### Key Command Patterns
- Commands are markdown files in `.claude/commands/`
- Subdirectories create categories: `/project:category:command`
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input
- Always use second-person voice ("you")
- Include explicit output handling for @bash directives

### Configuration Hierarchy
1. Enterprise policies (highest)
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (.claude/settings.local.json)
4. Shared project settings (.claude/settings.json)  
5. User settings (~/.claude/settings.json) (lowest)

This opens up new possibilities for FlowLoom command development and configuration management.
