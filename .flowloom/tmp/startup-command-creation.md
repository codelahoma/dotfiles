# Startup Command Creation

## What Was Built
Created comprehensive startup context system:

### Knowledge Organization
1. **Startup Context Index** - Primary entry point for essential knowledge
2. **Current Working Context** - Active state and session summary
3. **Special Tagging** - `startup_essential: true` and `context_category` fields

### Claude Command
- **Location**: `.claude/commands/startup/context.md`
- **Usage**: `/project:startup:context [quick|session|commands]`
- **Function**: Gathers and presents all startup context systematically

### Key Features
- Reads essential documents from basic-memory
- Checks active todos and recent activity
- Reviews methodology and command patterns
- Presents structured summary for immediate productivity

This solves the context loss problem by providing systematic knowledge recovery.
