Started with single-column markdown table\n2. Attempted 3-column compact format\n3. Tried inline bold labels within cells\n4. Moved to plain list due to rendering issues\n5. Final: 2x2 ANSI table with proper truncation\n\n### Truncation Strategy\n- Directory paths: show end with leading `...` (preserve meaningful part)\n- Context text: standard ellipsis truncation\n- Fixed column widths (45 chars each) for consistent display\n\n## Command Integration\n\n### Footer Command Structure\n- Delegates to `stdlib:startup-context` for reusable patterns\n- Auto-tracking verification before display\n- Uses `--from-file` pattern to avoid TUI permission prompts\n- HTML comment reminders for memory system tracking\n\n### Tool Usage Corrections\n- Use Read tool for specific file access, not Task tool\n- Use unified FlowLoom memory tool with `--from-file` pattern\n- Avoid long command lines that trigger permission prompts\n- Create temp files in `.flowloom/tmp` for rich content\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Python Script Structure\n```python\n- get_git_stats(): Parse git status for M/? counts\n- get_current_branch(): Git branch detection\n- get_working_dir(): Current directory\n- format_footer(): 2x2 ANSI table generation with truncation\n- main(): CLI argument parsing and execution\n```\n\n### ANSI Box Drawing\n- Top: \u250c\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510\n- Middle: \u251c\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2524  \n- Bottom: \u2514\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2518\n- Vertical: \u2502\n\n### Display Order\n1. Next Steps (numbered list)\n2. Usage instructions\n3. ANSI status table (as summary)\n\n## Methodology Reinforcement\n\n### Memory System Usage\n- Use both fl-memory.json (entities/observations) and basic-memory (documentation)\n- Always use relative paths from project root\n- Employ `--from-file` pattern for rich content and TUI compatibility\n- Document everything as you go to prevent repetition\n\n### Development Approach\n- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones\n- Follow established code patterns and conventions\n- Test iteratively with immediate feedback\n- Focus on practical solutions over theoretical perfection\n\nThis session successfully created a comprehensive footer system that enhances FlowLoom AI's post-interaction workflow with proper context display and memory tracking reminders.","tags":["technical","resolved","architecture","documentation","issue","configuration","workflow"]}]}

Changed git stats from symbolic (4M, 3?) to descriptive (4 modified, 3 untracked)\n2. Removed \"Next Steps\" header for cleaner appearance\n3. Eliminated unnecessary blank lines throughout footer\n4. Maintained divider structure with clean spacing\n5. Updated startup context command to display footer after context loading\n\n## Final Footer Structure:\n- Memory status table with alignment\n- Divider line (80 dashes)\n- [RESPONSE_OUTPUT] placeholder with blank line brackets\n- Divider line (80 dashes)  \n- Numbered action items (no header)\n- Usage instruction\n\n## Benefits:\n- More readable git status information\n- Cleaner visual appearance without unnecessary headers\n- Consistent spacing with only essential blank lines\n- Professional structure suitable for development workflows\n- Integrated with startup context for comprehensive session initialization\n\n## Memory Integration:\nFooter command now includes explicit memory logging protocol reminder, ensuring AI logs activities before display. This creates automatic habit formation for dual memory system tracking.\n\nThis completes the footer development with comprehensive memory tracking integration and optimal user experience design.","tags":["architecture","workflow"]}]}
