# Session 2025-06-08: Org Files Reorganization Recovery

## Context Recovery
Rod mentioned we were working on reorganizing org files and that I should have been logging activities to FlowLoom memory but haven't been. This session is about:

1. **Recovering context** - Found the comprehensive migration plan in display.md
2. **Understanding current state** - home/org-files is a copy of actual org directory for work
3. **Assessing progress** - Need to determine what work has already been completed
4. **Proper documentation** - Establishing memory tracking for this session

## Key Discoveries This Session

### Migration Plan Found
Located comprehensive plan in `display.md` for "Unified Org-Roam + GTD System Design":
- **Philosophy**: "Org-Roam as Knowledge Base, Org-Agenda as Action Engine"
- **Structure**: ~/org/ with work/personal separation + unified roam
- **Features**: Context switching, capture templates, custom agenda views
- **Keybindings**: SPC o o keyspace for all org operations
- **Visual preservation**: Keep existing 21 color schemes + 9 bullet sets

### Current Branch Context
- On `org-mode-gtd-refactor` branch
- Git history shows "org dir flattening work" and "full mono org mode" commits
- Recent commits focused on MCP server fixes, not org reorganization

### Directory Analysis
- `home/org-files/` contains extensive org content:
  - Core GTD files: gtd.org, inbox.org, tickler.org, someday.org
  - Large roam-notes/ and roam-archive/ directories
  - Multiple standalone org files scattered throughout
  - elfeed-db/ and data/ directories

### Current GTD Status
- gtd.org shows time tracking setup but minimal recent activity
- inbox.org has some recent captures
- Structure needs reorganization per migration plan

## Methodology Learning
Rod corrected my approach to knowledge documentation:
- ❌ Avoid `cat` with here-documents due to reliability issues
- ✅ Use file-based workflow: Write markdown directly to .knowledge structure
- ✅ Include proper front matter with FlowLoom schema
- ✅ Sync with: `uvx basic-memory --project ./.flowloom/.knowledge sync`

## Next Steps Identified
1. Check if any migration work has already been started
2. Assess what content needs to be migrated vs. what's already in place
3. Begin systematic implementation of the migration plan
4. Ensure proper FlowLoom memory documentation going forward

## Observations
- [critical] Context loss occurred due to inadequate session tracking
- [workflow] File-based approach for basic-memory is more reliable than heredocs
- [methodology] Proper front matter schema enables better knowledge discovery
- [recovery] Migration plan in display.md provides clear implementation roadmap

## Relations
- continues [[Unified Org-Roam GTD System]]
- implements [[FlowLoom Documentation Methodology]]
- prepares_for [[Org Migration Implementation]]
