# Org Reorganization Status Assessment - 2025-06-08

## Completed Work Analysis

### ✅ **Basic Structure Started**
- **Directory Created**: `home/org/` exists (only contains discworld files currently)
- **Branch Context**: On `org-mode-gtd-refactor` branch with recent "full mono org mode" commit
- **Config Changes**: Spacemacs configuration has been simplified and cleaned up

### ✅ **Spacemacs Configuration Progress**
- **Layer Configuration**: Org layer fully configured with roam, modern features enabled
- **Visual System**: 21 color schemes and 9 bullet sets preserved in spacemacs-config/tools/org-mode.org
- **Package Management**: Essential packages included (org-roam-bibtex, org-noter, etc.)
- **Recent Cleanup**: Removed unused layers (ruby, hy, prolog, sql, ess, plantuml, etc.)

### ✅ **Working Copy Established**
- **Sandbox Directory**: `home/org-files/` contains full copy of org content for reorganization
- **Content Preserved**: All existing GTD files, roam notes, and data intact
- **File Activity**: Several org files have been modified recently (newer than org-mode config)

## ❌ **Missing Implementation**

### **Core GTD Workflow Missing**
Based on migration plan in display.md, these are NOT implemented:

1. **TODO Keywords**: Still using default, need context-aware system
2. **Capture Templates**: No work/personal/roam capture templates configured
3. **Agenda Views**: No custom dashboards (w/p/u for work/personal/unified)
4. **Context Switching**: No org-work-mode/org-personal-mode functions
5. **Keybindings**: SPC o o keyspace not extended with migration plan bindings

### **File Structure Incomplete**
The migration plan calls for:
```
~/org/
├── inbox.org              # ❌ Missing
├── work/                  # ❌ Missing
│   ├── projects.org       # ❌ Missing
│   ├── gtd.org           # ❌ Missing
│   └── someday.org       # ❌ Missing
├── personal/              # ❌ Missing
│   ├── projects.org       # ❌ Missing
│   ├── gtd.org           # ❌ Missing
│   └── someday.org       # ❌ Missing
├── archive.org            # ❌ Missing
└── roam/                  # ❌ Missing
```

Current `home/org/` only has discworld content, not the planned structure.

### **Content Migration Pending**
- **Current Content**: All content still in `home/org-files/` sandbox
- **Migration Needed**: Content must be reorganized according to migration plan
- **Existing Files**: gtd.org, inbox.org, someday.org, tickler.org need restructuring

## Current Branch Analysis

### Git Context
- **Branch**: `org-mode-gtd-refactor` 
- **Recent Work**: "switch to full mono org mode" commit simplified spacemacs config
- **Cleanup**: Removed unused language layers and packages
- **Focus**: Appears to be preparing for org-mode focus

### File Status
- **Modified Files**: Multiple org files newer than org-mode config
- **Working Directory**: Several modified files awaiting commit
- **Staging**: Ready for continued implementation

## Next Steps Required

### Phase 1: File Structure Creation
1. Create the complete `~/org/` directory structure per migration plan
2. Set up initial work/, personal/, and roam/ subdirectories
3. Create template files (inbox.org, archive.org, etc.)

### Phase 2: Content Migration
1. Analyze existing content in org-files/ for categorization
2. Move and reorganize content into work/personal/roam structure
3. Update file references and links

### Phase 3: Configuration Implementation  
1. Add TODO keywords and tags for work/personal context
2. Configure capture templates for different contexts
3. Set up custom agenda views (dashboards)
4. Implement context switching functions
5. Add SPC o o keybinding extensions

### Phase 4: Workflow Integration
1. Test complete workflow with sample content
2. Validate roam + GTD integration
3. Ensure visual system preservation
4. Document final implementation

## Assessment Summary

**Progress**: ~25% complete
- ✅ Foundational spacemacs configuration ready
- ✅ Working copy of content available
- ✅ Basic directory structure started
- ❌ Core workflow implementation missing
- ❌ Content migration not completed
- ❌ Advanced configuration not implemented

**Recommendation**: Continue with systematic implementation starting with file structure creation and content migration, then add workflow configuration.

## Observations
- [status] Significant preparatory work completed but core implementation missing
- [structure] Directory skeleton exists but migration plan structure not implemented  
- [config] Spacemacs ready for org-mode focus after cleanup
- [content] All source content preserved and available for migration
