# GTD System Greenfield Session - Research Complete

## Session Summary
Completed comprehensive research phase for greenfield GTD system implementation in Spacemacs/org-mode.

## Research Completed
1. **Spacemacs Keybinding System Research** - Documented leader key patterns, evil-leader integration, which-key menus
2. **Org-Babel Literate Programming Research** - Covered source blocks, tangling, noweb references, modular architecture
3. **GTD Package Analysis and Best Practices** - Analyzed org-gtd.el, emacs-gtd, practical.org.el for architectural insights

## Key Decisions
- Implementation will be personal-use only (no package distribution concerns)
- Using `home/codelahoma-org.org` as source file (tangles to `home/.spacemacs.d/codelahoma-org.el`)
- Will overwrite existing failed attempt with greenfield implementation
- Created new branch `gtd-system-greenfield` in org-files repo
- Backed up existing GTD files to `gtd-backup-20250613`

## Architecture Insights
- Modular progressive enhancement approach recommended
- Start simple with minimal states, evolve gradually
- Prioritize frictionless capture above all else
- Use reserved `SPC o g` keyspace for GTD hierarchy
- Leverage org-babel for maintainable literate configuration

## Next Phase
Ready for synthesis phase with different model to architect the greenfield GTD system based on research findings.

## Relations
- Builds-on: research/Spacemacs Keybinding System Research
- Builds-on: research/Org-Babel Literate Programming Research  
- Builds-on: research/GTD Package Analysis and Best Practices
- Supersedes: previous GTD implementation attempt in codelahoma-org.org
