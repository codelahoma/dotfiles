# GTD Capture Fixes Applied

## Overview
Applied comprehensive fixes to the GTD capture templates and structure creation function based on the suggested improvements in `rkgtd-capture-updates.el`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced GTD Structure Creation
**File**: `home/codelahoma-org.org` around line 48-74
**Changes**:
- Modified `rk/create-gtd-structure()` to create proper headings for capture targets
- Added automatic heading creation: "Tasks", "High Energy Tasks", "Low Energy Tasks" for gtd.org files
- Added "Active Projects" heading for projects.org files  
- Added "Someday/Maybe" heading for someday.org files
- Improved function documentation

### 2. Updated Capture Templates
**File**: `home/codelahoma-org.org` around line 372-430
**Changes**:
- **Quick Note Enhancement**: Added `:immediate-finish t` to "n" template for instant capture
- **SCHEDULED Format**: Changed from `%^{Scheduled}t` to `SCHEDULED: %^{Scheduled}t` for proper org formatting
- **Energy-based Templates**: Added new template category "e" with:
  - `eh` - High Energy Task (targets "High Energy Tasks" heading)
  - `el` - Low Energy Task (targets "Low Energy Tasks" heading)
- **Personal Someday**: Added `sp` template for personal someday items
- **Template Reorganization**: Restructured template hierarchy for better organization

### 3. Template Structure Improvements
- **Better Organization**: Templates now grouped logically (Quick Note, Basic GTD, Work, Personal, Energy-based, Someday)
- **Proper Target Headings**: All templates now target specific headings that are auto-created by structure function
- **Enhanced Properties**: Added ENERGY_REQUIRED property for energy-based templates
- **Effort Estimates**: Tailored effort prompts for different template types

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
- Updated GTD structure creation function with heading insertion
- Enhanced capture templates with all suggested fixes
- Added energy-based capture workflows
- Added personal someday template
- Improved template organization and targeting

### ⏸️ Pending
- **Tangling Required**: Need to regenerate `.spacemacs.d/codelahoma-org.el` from the org source
- **Testing**: Validate that new structure and templates work correctly
- **Spacemacs Reload**: Restart Spacemacs to load new configuration

## Key Benefits

### Immediate Capture
- Quick notes now finish immediately without additional prompts
- Reduces friction for rapid capture workflow

### Proper Scheduling
- SCHEDULED: format ensures proper org-mode date handling
- Better integration with agenda views

### Energy Management
- High/low energy templates support GTD energy-level organization
- Dedicated headings for different energy requirements

### Complete Coverage
- Personal someday template fills gap in personal workflow
- All major GTD capture scenarios now covered

## Next Steps

1. **Tangle Configuration**: Run `C-c C-v t` in codelahoma-org.org to regenerate elisp
2. **Test Structure Creation**: Execute `(rk/create-gtd-structure)` to validate heading creation
3. **Test Capture Templates**: Try each new template type to ensure proper targeting
4. **Validate Workflow**: Confirm all templates work with agenda views

## Technical Notes

### File Locations
- **Source**: `home/codelahoma-org.org` (literate programming)
- **Generated**: `home/.spacemacs.d/codelahoma-org.el` (tangled elisp)
- **GTD Files**: `~/personal/org-files/` (structure created by function)

### Template Keys
- `n` - Quick Note (immediate finish)
- `i` - Inbox (standard capture)
- `wt/pt` - Work/Personal Task (with SCHEDULED)
- `eh/el` - High/Low Energy Tasks
- `sp/sw` - Personal/Work Someday

## Observations
- [implementation] Successfully applied all suggested fixes from rkgtd-capture-updates.el
- [enhancement] Added energy-based workflow support for better GTD practice
- [organization] Improved template hierarchy and documentation
- [targeting] Ensured all templates target auto-created headings
- [workflow] Reduced capture friction with immediate finish option
