# Plan System Knowledge Base Migration - Session Log

## Session Overview
Completed comprehensive planning for migrating plan-related commands and scripts from file-based storage to knowledge base integration.

## Key Activities

### 1. System Analysis
- Identified shell scripts needing updates: new_plan, find_plan, recent_plans, review_plans
- Identified Claude commands needing updates: smart-create, mem, update, review, status, detailed, highlevel, arch, vision, subsection
- Discovered mode:workflow also needs knowledge base integration

### 2. Migration Plan Created
- Designed 5-phase migration approach
- Created unified plan schema with metadata
- Defined implementation timeline (3-4 weeks)
- Established success criteria and migration strategy

### 3. Key Decisions
- Use knowledge base for all plan storage (not file system)
- Implement plan lifecycle management (draft → active → completed → archived)
- Create shared utilities for consistent KB operations
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

## Discoveries
- mode:workflow is critical component needing KB integration
- Plan relationships (parent/child, dependencies) need tracking
- Session management and progress tracking would benefit from KB
- Analytics and metrics can be derived from KB-stored plans

## Next Actions
1. Create shared KB utility functions
2. Design and document plan schema
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Set up migration script for existing plans

This session established the foundation for modernizing the entire plan management system to use persistent knowledge base storage.
