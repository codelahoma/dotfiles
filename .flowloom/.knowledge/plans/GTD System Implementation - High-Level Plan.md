# GTD System Implementation - High-Level Plan

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive GTD (Getting Things Done) system for Spacemacs using org-babel literate programming, based on the architectural synthesis from our extensive research.

## Project Goals

1. **Create a literate programming GTD system** that serves as both documentation and implementation
2. **Build progressively enhanceable components** starting with core functionality
3. **Integrate seamlessly with Spacemacs** using native patterns and conventions
4. **Optimize for developer workflow** with fast capture and minimal friction
5. **Enable context-aware productivity** through intelligent templates and workflows

## Major Components

### 100. Foundation Setup
- Create org-babel literate programming document structure
- Set up development and testing environment
- Configure basic file organization
- Establish component architecture

### 110. Core GTD Engine
- Implement state management system
- Create basic capture templates
- Set up file organization structure
- Configure org-agenda integration

### 120. Keybinding System
- Implement `SPC o o` hierarchical keybindings
- Create which-key menu descriptions
- Set up major-mode GTD keybindings
- Configure quick action shortcuts

### 130. Capture System
- Build context-aware capture templates
- Implement smart context detection
- Create immediate processing options
- Set up template hierarchy

### 140. Processing Workflow
- Implement two-minute rule processor
- Create guided clarification interface
- Build inbox processing commands
- Set up delegation workflows

### 150. Review System
- Create daily/weekly/monthly review templates
- Implement review automation
- Build progress tracking
- Set up completion statistics

### 160. Context Engine
- Implement location/energy context filtering
- Create context switching commands
- Build dynamic context menus
- Set up time-based context detection

### 170. Integration Layer
- Connect with org-roam knowledge base
- Integrate with existing org-agenda
- Set up cross-system navigation
- Configure export options

### 180. Testing Framework
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Implement fixture patterns
- Build integration tests
- Set up performance benchmarks

### 190. Documentation & Migration
- Complete user documentation
- Create migration utilities
- Build training materials
- Set up example workflows

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Components 100-110: Basic structure and core engine
- Deliverable: Working GTD core with basic capture

### Phase 2: Workflow (Weeks 3-4)  
- Components 120-140: Keybindings, capture, and processing
- Deliverable: Complete capture-to-action workflow

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- Components 150-160: Reviews and context engine
- Deliverable: Full GTD methodology implementation

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- Components 170-190: Integration, testing, documentation
- Deliverable: Production-ready system with migration tools

## Technical Stack

- **Core**: Org-mode 9.6+, Spacemacs, Evil-mode
- **Development**: Org-babel, ERT testing
- **Enhancement**: Vertico, Consult, Which-key
- **Integration**: Org-roam, Org-agenda

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: < 5 second capture, < 30 second processing
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, comprehensive test coverage
3. **Usability**: Intuitive keybindings, minimal learning curve
4. **Integration**: Seamless with existing Spacemacs workflow
5. **Maintainability**: Self-documenting literate programming

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity**: Modular architecture allows incremental development
2. **Performance**: Lazy loading and caching from the start
3. **Adoption**: Familiar Spacemacs patterns reduce learning curve
4. **Migration**: Automated tools minimize disruption

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed implementation plan for each component
2. Set up org-babel development environment
3. Begin Component 100: Foundation Setup
4. Establish testing patterns early
