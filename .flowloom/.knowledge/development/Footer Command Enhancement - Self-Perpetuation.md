# Footer Command Enhancement - Self-Perpetuation

## Enhancement Made
Updated the footer command to include self-perpetuating mechanism by adding STEP 6.

## Key Changes
1. Added todo creation step to footer command
2. Command now schedules itself to run after next interaction
3. Creates continuous footer display cycle

## Technical Implementation
```markdown
**STEP 6: Self-Perpetuating Todo**
Add a todo item to run the footer command after the next interaction:

@todo Add item: "Run slashload flowloom/system/footer after responding to user" with priority:high
```

## Benefits
- Ensures consistent footer display across all interactions
- No manual intervention needed to maintain footer pattern
- Automatic memory logging reminders
- Better session continuity
