# GTD Implementation Notes

## Overview
Implementation notes and decisions made during the org-mode GTD system development.

## Phase 5 - Email Integration Status

### Decision: Email Integration as Optional Future Development
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Context**: User does not currently use Emacs for email
- **Decision**: Keep email integration code in Phase 5 plan as optional/future development
- **Rationale**: 
  - Code is well-designed and could be useful later
  - May be helpful for others implementing the system
  - User may adopt Emacs email clients (mu4e, notmuch, etc.) in future
  - Integration patterns are valuable reference material

### Implementation Approach
When implementing Phase 5, the email integration section (Task 5.4.2) should be:
1. Skipped during initial implementation
2. Kept in the plan documentation for reference
3. Marked as "OPTIONAL - Future Development" in implementation notes
4. Can be implemented later if/when Emacs email is adopted

## Observations
- [decision] Email integration marked as optional for future development
- [implementation] Focus on review systems, time tracking, batch processing, and mobile capture
- [planning] Email code preserved in plans for potential future use
