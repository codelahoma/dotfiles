# Technical Issue: Org-babel Noweb + #+INCLUDE Interaction

## The Specific Problem
During our Spacemacs GTD implementation, we discovered that **#+INCLUDE directives are not processed during org-babel tangling when using noweb references**.

## What We Tried
1. **Modular Approach**: Created separate .org files for different GTD components
2. **#+INCLUDE Integration**: Used `#+INCLUDE: "path/to/file.org"` to combine files
3. **Noweb Tangling**: Attempted to tangle with `:noweb-ref` blocks across included files

## What Failed
- The #+INCLUDE directives were **not processed** during `org-babel-tangle`
- Noweb references in included files were **not found** by the tangling process
- Result: Empty or incomplete tangled output with missing noweb blocks

## Root Cause Analysis
- This is **not a general org-mode limitation**
- This is a **specific interaction issue** between:
  - `#+INCLUDE` directive processing
  - `org-babel-tangle` function  
  - `:noweb-ref` reference resolution

## Technical Details
- #+INCLUDE works fine for **export** (HTML, PDF, etc.)
- #+INCLUDE works fine for **regular org viewing**
- #+INCLUDE **does not work** during **tangling operations**
- Noweb references need to be in the **same buffer** being tangled

## Our Solution
Instead of fighting this technical limitation, we implemented:
1. **Monolithic org file** for core configuration (works with tangling)
2. **Separate extension file** that tangles independently
3. **Load-time integration** where main config loads the extension elisp

## Alternative Solutions We Could Have Explored
1. **Custom tangling function** that pre-processes #+INCLUDE
2. **Build script** that concatenates files before tangling  
3. **Advice functions** to modify org-babel-tangle behavior
4. **Different modularity approach** using `load` or `require`

## Lesson Learned
Sometimes the **pragmatic solution** (separate extension file) is better than **fighting the tool** (trying to make #+INCLUDE work with tangling).

This is a good example of **tool limitations** driving **architectural decisions**.

## Related Issues
- org-transclusion also failed for the same underlying reason
- Both external reference methods hit the buffer-local tangling limitation
