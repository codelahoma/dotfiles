## Architectural Patterns Analysis

### 1. File Organization Strategies

**Single File Approach**:
- All GTD content in one main file (gtd.org)
- Uses org-mode headings for separation
- Simpler maintenance but can become unwieldy

**Multi-File Approach**:
- Separate files for each GTD component
- Common pattern: inbox.org, projects.org, actions.org, someday.org
- Better organization but requires file synchronization

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Core GTD files + specialized files for specific domains
- Example: main GTD files + work.org, personal.org
- Balances organization with maintainability

### 2. State Management Approaches

**Minimal States**:
```
TODO → DONE
TODO → CANCELLED
```

**Standard GTD States**:
```
TODO → NEXT → DONE
TODO → WAITING → DONE
TODO → SOMEDAY → TODO
```

**Extended States**:
```
TODO → NEXT → DOING → DONE
IDEA → TODO → NEXT → DOING → DONE
PROJECT → ACTIVE → SOMEDAY → DONE
```

**Best Practice**: Use minimal states initially, expand based on workflow needs

### 3. Context and Tag Systems

**Context Tags (@-prefix)**:
- @home, @office, @phone, @email, @errands
- Enables location-based task filtering
- Integrates with org-agenda filtering

**Area Tags (no prefix)**:
- work, personal, health, finance
- Represents different life areas
- Useful for high-level reviews

**Project Tags**:
- :project: for project headings
- :goal: for high-level objectives
- :habit: for recurring activities

### 4. Capture and Processing Patterns

**Global Capture Keybinding**:
```elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture)
```

**Template-Based Capture**:
- Task capture: Quick entry with minimal fields
- Meeting capture: Pre-filled with participants and agenda
- Idea capture: Unstructured with tagging prompts

**Processing Workflows**:
- Batch processing during dedicated review times
- Just-in-time processing for urgent items
- Automated processing with org-edna for routine tasks
