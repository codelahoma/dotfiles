# GTD System Architectural Synthesis

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research across six domains—GTD architecture, Elisp fundamentals, capture templates, Spacemacs keybindings, org-babel literate programming, and existing GTD packages—combined with insights from the original unified GTD org-roam system, this document synthesizes architectural decisions for a greenfield GTD implementation.

## Core Architectural Philosophy

### **"Progressive Enhancement through Literate Programming"**

The system will be built using org-babel literate programming as a **living architecture document** that generates a modular, progressively enhanceable GTD system. This approach combines:

- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Architecture decisions and implementation live together
- **Modular Component Design**: Clear separation of concerns with optional enhancements  
- **Spacemacs-Native Integration**: Leverages existing patterns and conventions
- **Evolutionary Capability**: Easy to extend and refine over time

## Foundational Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Implementation Approach: Literate Programming**

**Decision**: Implement the entire GTD system as a single org-babel document that tangles to multiple Elisp files.

**Rationale**: 
- Combines documentation and implementation in one maintainable source
- Enables modular architecture through noweb references
- Supports iterative development with interactive evaluation
- Creates self-documenting system architecture

**Structure**:
```
gtd-system.org
├── Architecture Documentation (prose)
├── Core System (elisp blocks)
├── Workflow Modules (elisp blocks) 
├── Keybinding Definitions (elisp blocks)
├── Testing Framework (elisp blocks)
└── Integration Patterns (elisp blocks)
```

### 2. **System Architecture: Component-Based Design**

**Decision**: Modular component architecture with progressive enhancement.

**Core Components**:
- **GTD Core**: State management, file organization, basic workflows
- **Capture Engine**: Enhanced capture templates with context awareness
- **Processing Engine**: Inbox processing and clarification workflows  
- **Context Engine**: Location and energy-based filtering
- **Review Engine**: Daily, weekly, monthly review cycles
- **Integration Layer**: Spacemacs, org-agenda, org-roam connections

**Enhancement Modules**:
- **Analytics Module**: Productivity tracking and insights
- **AI Module**: Context suggestion and categorization assistance
- **Mobile Module**: Enhanced mobile synchronization
- **Team Module**: Collaborative GTD workflows

### 3. **File Organization: Hybrid Multi-File Strategy**

**Decision**: Adopt enhanced version of the original unified system structure with improvements from research.

**Structure** (builds on original plan):
```
~/org/
├── inbox.org                    # Universal capture point
├── next-actions.org            # All next actions (context-tagged)
├── projects.org                # Project definitions and outcomes  
├── someday-maybe.org           # Future possibilities
├── waiting-for.org             # Delegated items tracking
├── contexts/                   # Context-specific views
│   ├── work.org               # Work-specific contexts
│   ├── home.org               # Home-specific contexts  
│   └── mobile.org             # Mobile-friendly contexts
├── reviews/                   # Structured review process
│   ├── daily-template.org     # Daily review template
│   ├── weekly-template.org    # Weekly review template
│   └── monthly-template.org   # Monthly review template
├── archive/                   # Completed items
└── roam/                      # Knowledge base integration
```

**Key Improvements from Research**:
- Separate `next-actions.org` for better performance
- Dedicated `waiting-for.org` for delegated items
- Context-specific files for mobile optimization
- Review templates for consistent practice

### 4. **State Management: Extended Workflow States**

**Decision**: Progressive state system starting simple, enabling complexity.

**Core States** (Level 1):
```elisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "INBOX(i)" "NEXT(n)" "TODO(t)" "WAITING(w@/!)" 
                  "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELLED(c@)")))
```

**Enhanced States** (Level 2 - Optional):
```elisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "INBOX(i)" "NEXT(n)" "TODO(t)" "PROJ(p)" 
                  "WAITING(w@/!)" "SOMEDAY(s)" 
                  "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELLED(c@)" "ARCHIVED(a)")))
```

**Context Integration**:
- Energy levels: `#High` `#Medium` `#Low`
- Time estimates: `#15min` `#30min` `#1hr` `#2hr+`
- Contexts: `@computer` `@phone` `@home` `@office` `@errands`

### 5. **Keybinding Architecture: Hierarchical Mnemonic System**

**Decision**: Use reserved `SPC o o` namespace with workflow-oriented hierarchy.

**Primary Hierarchy**:
```
SPC o o           # GTD Main Menu
├── c             # Capture
│   ├── i         # Inbox (universal)
│   ├── t         # Task (context-aware)
│   ├── p         # Project
│   ├── n         # Note
│   └── r         # Reference
├── p             # Process  
│   ├── i         # Process Inbox
│   ├── c         # Clarify Item
│   └── o         # Organize Item
├── r             # Review
│   ├── d         # Daily Review
│   ├── w         # Weekly Review
│   └── m         # Monthly Review
├── f             # Focus (Context Views)
│   ├── n         # Next Actions
│   ├── p         # Projects
│   ├── w         # Waiting For
│   └── c         # Context-specific
└── q             # Quick Actions
    ├── t         # Toggle Context
    ├── s         # Schedule Item
    └── d         # Deadline Item
```

**Integration with Major Mode**:
```
SPC m g           # GTD actions in org-mode
├── c             # Context operations  
├── e             # Energy assignment
├── t             # Time estimation
└── s             # State transitions
```

### 6. **Capture System: Context-Aware Templates**

**Decision**: Enhanced capture templates with intelligent context detection and immediate processing options.

**Template Architecture**:
```elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      `(("g" "GTD System")
        ("gi" "Inbox" entry (file "inbox.org")
         "* INBOX %?\n  CAPTURED: %U\n  FROM: %a\n"
         :immediate-finish t)
        ("gt" "Task" entry (file "next-actions.org") 
         "* NEXT %?\n  CAPTURED: %U\n  CONTEXT: %(gtd/smart-context)\n  ENERGY: %(gtd/suggest-energy)\n"
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("gp" "Project" entry (file "projects.org")
         "* PROJ %? :project:\n  CAPTURED: %U\n  OUTCOME: \n  NEXT ACTION: \n")))
```

**Smart Context Features**:
- Time-based context detection (work hours → @office)
- Location-aware suggestions (if available)
- Previous context learning
- Energy level suggestions based on time/calendar

### 7. **Processing Workflow: Guided Clarification**

**Decision**: Implement guided two-minute rule processing with keyboard-driven workflow.

**Processing Interface**:
```elisp
(defun gtd/process-inbox-item ()
  "Process current inbox item with guided workflow."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((item (org-get-heading t t t t))
         (actionable (gtd/ask-actionable-p item))
         (multi-step (when actionable (gtd/ask-multi-step-p item))))
    (cond
     ((not actionable) (gtd/handle-non-actionable))
     (multi-step (gtd/convert-to-project))
     (t (gtd/convert-to-next-action)))))
```

**Two-Minute Rule Integration**:
- Automatic timer for 2-minute rule evaluation
- Quick "Do Now" option with time tracking
- Seamless delegation workflow
- Context assignment during processing

### 8. **Review System: Structured Cycles**

**Decision**: Template-driven review system with completion tracking.

**Daily Review Template**:
```org
* Daily Review - %<%Y-%m-%d>
** Review Calendar
- [ ] Check today's appointments
- [ ] Review scheduled items
- [ ] Identify time blocks

** Process Inbox  
- [ ] Inbox items processed: 0
- [ ] New next actions: 0

** Focus Selection
- [ ] Top 3 priorities identified
- [ ] Context selected: 
- [ ] Energy level: 

** Reflection
- What went well: 
- What to improve: 
- Tomorrow's focus:
```

**Review Automation**:
- Auto-generation of review templates
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Integration with calendar and agenda
- Completion statistics and trends

### 9. **Integration Strategy: Native Org-Mode Enhancement**

**Decision**: Build on org-mode strengths rather than replacing functionality.

**Org-Agenda Integration**:
```elisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("g" . "GTD Views")
        ("gn" "Next Actions" tags-todo "+TODO=\"NEXT\""
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(category-up priority-down))))
        ("gw" "Waiting For" tags-todo "+TODO=\"WAITING\""
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(deadline-up))))
        ("gc" "Contexts" tags-todo "@computer|@phone|@home|@office"
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(tag-up category-up))))))
```

**Org-Roam Integration**:
- Project notes link to roam knowledge base
- Reference capture creates roam nodes
- Knowledge workflows feed into GTD actions
- Seamless navigation between systems

### 10. **Performance and Scalability**

**Decision**: Design for performance from the start with lazy loading and caching.
