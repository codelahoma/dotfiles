* Welcome to Your GTD System!

This tutorial will guide you through learning your new Getting Things Done (GTD) system in Spacemacs. We'll start with the basics and gradually build up to advanced features.

** What You'll Learn
- How to capture tasks and ideas quickly
- How to organize tasks by context (work/personal)
- How to use agenda views to see what needs doing
- How to process and organize your inbox
- How to review and maintain your system

** Prerequisites
- Spacemacs is installed and running
- You've completed the Phase 1 setup (directory structure created)
- Basic familiarity with Spacemacs keybindings (SPC = Space key)

* Day 1: Capturing Your First Tasks

** Understanding the Capture System

The capture system is your quick entry point for any task, idea, or note. Think of it as your "trusted inbox" where everything goes first.

** Basic Capture Shortcuts

All capture commands start with =SPC o o c=:

| Key Sequence | What it Captures | Where it Goes |
|--------------+------------------+---------------|
| SPC o o c i  | Quick inbox item | inbox.org     |
| SPC o o c t  | Context task     | work/personal |
| SPC o o c n  | Quick note       | inbox.org     |
| SPC o o c p  | New project      | projects.org  |

** Exercise 1: Capture Your First Task

1. Press =SPC o o c i= (inbox capture)
2. Type: "Learn GTD system in Spacemacs"
3. Press =C-c C-c= to save

Congratulations! You've captured your first task.

** Exercise 2: Capture with Context

Let's capture a work task:

1. Press =SPC o o c t= (context task)
2. If in unified mode, select "work" 
3. Type: "Email team about project update"
4. Notice it's automatically tagged with =@work=
5. Press =C-c C-c= to save

** Exercise 3: Quick Notes

Sometimes you just need to jot something down:

1. Press =SPC o o c n= (quick note)
2. Type: "Remember to check new coffee shop downtown"
3. This saves immediately - no =C-c C-c= needed!

** Understanding Capture Templates

When you capture, you'll notice some automatic formatting:
- =TODO= keyword is added
- =CAPTURED:= timestamp shows when you added it
- Context tags (like =@work=) are applied
- Some templates ask for additional info (like scheduling)

* Day 2: Viewing Your Tasks with Agenda

** Opening Your Agenda Views

The agenda is your command center. Access it with =SPC o o a=:

| Key Sequence | View           | What it Shows                |
|--------------+----------------+------------------------------|
| SPC o o a w  | Work Dashboard | Only work tasks & schedule   |
| SPC o o a p  | Personal       | Only personal tasks          |
| SPC o o a u  | Unified        | Everything combined          |
| SPC o o a f  | Focus Mode     | Your top 3 priorities        |

** Exercise 1: Explore Work Dashboard

1. Press =SPC o o a w=
2. You'll see:
   - Today's date and scheduled items
   - Next Actions section
   - Waiting For items
   - Active Projects

** Exercise 2: Navigate the Agenda

While in agenda view:
- =j/k= - Move up/down
- =RET= - Jump to the task
- =t= - Change TODO state
- =:= - Set tags
- =s= - Schedule task
- =q= - Quit agenda

** Exercise 3: Your First Task Completion

1. In agenda, navigate to a task
2. Press =t= to cycle through states
3. Select =DONE=
4. Notice the completion timestamp!

** Understanding Agenda Structure

Each agenda view has sections:
- *Schedule*: Time-specific items
- *Next Actions*: Things you could do now
- *Waiting For*: Delegated or blocked items
- *Projects*: Multi-step outcomes

* Day 3: Processing Your Inbox

** The Inbox Processing Workflow

Your inbox is temporary storage. Everything should be processed into appropriate locations.

** Exercise 1: Process Inbox Items

1. Press =SPC o o g i= to go to inbox
2. For each item, ask:
   - Is it actionable? → Make it a task
   - Is it reference? → File it
   - Can I do it in 2 min? → Do it now
   - Is it trash? → Delete it

** Exercise 2: Use Quick Refile

1. Go to an inbox item
2. Press =SPC o o r r= (refile hydra)
3. Choose destination:
   - =w= - Work GTD
   - =p= - Personal GTD
   - =s= - Someday (work)
   - =S= - Someday (personal)

** Exercise 3: Bulk Processing

When you have many items:

1. Press =SPC o o c x p= (process inbox command)
2. Use quick keys:
   - =n= - Make NEXT action
   - =t= - Make TODO
   - =p= - Convert to project
   - =d= - Delete
   - =j/k= - Navigate

** The 2-Minute Rule

If something takes less than 2 minutes:
1. Do it immediately
2. Mark it =DONE=
3. Archive with =SPC o o A a=

* Day 4: Working with Contexts

** Understanding Context Modes

Your GTD system can focus on work, personal, or both:

| Mode     | What You See        | When to Use              |
|----------+---------------------+--------------------------|
| Work     | Only work items     | During work hours        |
| Personal | Only personal items | Personal time            |
| Unified  | Everything          | Planning, weekly reviews |

** Exercise 1: Switch Contexts

1. Press =SPC o o m m= (mode hydra)
2. Try each mode:
   - =w= - Work mode
   - =p= - Personal mode  
   - =u= - Unified mode
3. Notice how agenda views change!

** Exercise 2: Context-Aware Capture

1. Switch to work mode: =SPC o o m w=
2. Capture a task: =SPC o o c t=
3. Notice it automatically goes to work GTD
4. Switch to personal mode and try again

** Exercise 3: Use Context Tags

Add energy and time contexts:

1. On any task, press =:= (in agenda) or =C-c C-c= (in org file)
2. Add tags like:
   - =@high_energy= - Needs focus
   - =@low_energy= - Routine work
   - =@5min= - Quick tasks
   - =@deep= - Deep work

** Quick Context Reference

| Tag          | Meaning                | Best Time           |
|--------------+------------------------+---------------------|
| @work        | Work location          | Office hours        |
| @home        | Home location          | Evening/weekend     |
| @computer    | Needs computer         | At desk             |
| @phone       | Phone calls            | Anywhere            |
| @errands     | Out and about          | Lunch/commute       |
| @high_energy | Needs mental energy    | Morning             |
| @low_energy  | Routine tasks          | Afternoon slump     |
| @5min        | Very quick             | Between meetings    |
| @15min       | Quick tasks            | Short breaks        |
| @deep        | Deep focus needed      | Blocked time        |

* Day 5: Projects and Next Actions

** Understanding Projects

A project is any outcome requiring more than one action step.

** Exercise 1: Create Your First Project

1. Press =SPC o o c p= (project capture)
2. Enter project name: "Organize home office"
3. Choose context (personal)
4. Add a description
5. Notice the =[/]= - this tracks completion!

** Exercise 2: Add Next Actions to Project

1. Go to your project: =SPC o o g p=
2. Under the project heading, add tasks:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * TODO Organize home office [/]
     
   ** NEXT Clear desktop surface
   ** TODO Buy desk organizers
   ** TODO Set up filing system
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Exercise 3: Project Progress Tracking

1. As you complete tasks, the =[0/3]= updates
2. Use =C-c C-c= on the =[/]= to update manually
3. Projects without NEXT actions show as "stalled"

** Project Best Practices

- Always have at least one NEXT action
- Break large projects into sub-projects
- Review projects weekly
- Use =PROJECT= keyword for clear identification

* Day 6: Advanced Capture Templates

** Meeting Capture

Capture meeting notes with context:

1. Press =SPC o o c m= (meeting)
2. Fill in:
   - Meeting title
   - Attendees
   - Schedule time
3. Add agenda items in the template

** Energy-Based Capture

Quick capture based on your energy:

- =SPC o o c e l= - Low energy task
- =SPC o o c e h= - High energy task

These automatically get tagged for the right time!

** Habit Tracking

Create recurring habits:

1. Press =SPC o o c h=
2. Enter habit: "Morning meditation"
3. Set schedule: ".+1d" (daily)
4. Track with =DONE= each day

* Day 7: Your First Weekly Review

** The Weekly Review Process

The weekly review keeps your system trusted and current.

** Exercise: Run Your First Review

1. Press =SPC o o R w= (weekly review)
2. Follow each section:
   - ☐ Clear Inbox (get to zero!)
   - ☐ Review Action Lists
   - ☐ Review Projects
   - ☐ Review Waiting Items
   - ☐ Review Someday/Maybe
   - ☐ Review Calendar
   - ☐ Mind Sweep
   - ☐ Process Notes
   - ☐ Review Goals

3. Check off each item with =C-c C-c=

** What to Look For

During review:
- Projects without next actions → Add them
- Old waiting items → Follow up
- Someday items ready for action → Activate
- Completed projects → Archive

** Setting Weekly Priorities

At the end, identify your top 3 for the week:
1. Most important project milestone
2. Key deadline or commitment  
3. One personal priority

* Week 2: Building Habits
